a special world 
a special world for you and me 
a special bond one can not see 
it wraps us up in its cocoon 
and holds us fiercely in its womb  
its fingers spread like fine spun gold 
gently nestling us to the fold 
like silken thread it holds us fast 
bonds like this are meant to last  
and though at times a thread may break 
a new one forms in its wake 
to bind us closer and keep us strong 
in a special world  where we belong  
an entrapment 
my love  i have tried with all my being 
to grasp a form comparable to thine own 
but nothing seems worthy  
i know now why shakespeare could not 
compare his love to a summer day  
it would be a crime to denounce the beauty 
of such a creature as thee 
to simply cast away the precision 
god had placed in forging you  
each facet of your being 
whether it physical or spiritual 
is an ensnarement 
from which there is no release  
but i do not wish release  
i wish to stay entrapped forever  
with you for all eternity  
our hearts  always as one  
if i could have just one wish 
i would wish to wake up everyday 
to the sound of your breath on my neck 
the warmth of your lips on my cheek 
the touch of your fingers on my skin 
and the feel of your heart beating with mine 
knowing that i could never find that feeling 
with anyone other than you  
what i love about you 
i love the way you look at me 
your eyes so bright and blue  
i love the way you kiss me 
your lips so soft and smooth  
i love the way you make me so happy 
and the ways you show you care  
i love the way you say i love you 
and the way you 're always there  
i love the way you touch me 
always sending chills down my spine  
i love that you are with me 
and glad that you are mine  
a gentle word like a spark of light 
illuminates my soul 
and as each sound goes deeper 
it 's you that makes me whole 
there is no corner  no dark place 
your love can not fill 
and if the world starts causing waves 
it 's your devotion that makes them still 
and yes you always speak to me 
in sweet honesty and truth 
your caring heart keeps out the rain 
your love  the ultimate roof 
so thank you my love for being there 
for supporting me  my life 
i 'll do the same for you  you know 
my beautiful  darling wife  
a stranger you were once  
then  with a gentle look you took my hand  
as our lives engaged 
you lit my life and i held both your hands  
now that decades have passed 
ours souls have indeed become one  
how fortunate we are 
that we have found the love so true 
that everyone dreams about  
you 're my man  my mighty king 
and i 'm the jewel in your crown 
you 're the sun so hot and bright 
i 'm your light-rays shining down 
you 're the sky so vast and blue 
and i 'm the white clouds in your chest 
i 'm a river clean and pure 
who in your ocean finds her rest 
you 're the mountain huge and high 
i 'm the valley green and wide 
you 're the body firm and strong 
and i 'm a rib bone on your side 
you 're an eagle flying high 
i 'm your feathers light and brown 
you 're my man  my king of kings 
and i 'm the jewel in your crown  
never have i fallen 
your lips speak soft sweetness 
your touch a cool caress 
i am lost in your magic 
my heart beats within your chest 
i think of you each morning 
and dream of you each night 
i think of your arms being around me 
and can not express my delight 
never have i fallen 
but i am quickly on my way 
you hold a heart in your hands 
that has never before been given away 
your name 
i wrote your name in the sky 
but the wind blew it away  
i wrote your name in the sand 
but the waves washed it away  
i wrote your name in my heart 
and forever it will stay  
love is 
love is the greatest feeling 
love is like a play 
love is what i feel for you 
each and every day 
love is like a smile 
love is like a song 
love is a great emotion 
that keeps us going strong 
i love you with my heart 
my body and my soul 
i love the way i keep loving 
like a love i ca n't control 
so remember when your eyes meet mine 
i love you with all my heart 
and i have poured my entire soul into you 
right from the very start  
i will love you forever 
i love you so deeply 
i love you so much 
i love the sound of your voice 
and the way that we touch  
i love your warm smile 
and your kind  thoughtful way 
the joy that you bring 
to my life every day  
i love you today 
as i have from the start 
and i 'll love you forever 
with all of my heart  
all the love that history knows 
is said to be in every rose  
yet all that could be found in two 
is less than what i feel for you  
a white rose 
the red rose whispers of passion 
and the white rose breathes of love  
o  the red rose is a falcon 
and the white rose is a dove  
but i send you a cream-white rosebud 
with a flush on its petal tips  
for the love that is purest and sweetest 
has a kiss of desire on the lips  
my love 
my love is like an ocean 
it goes down so deep 
my love is like a rose 
whose beauty you want to keep  
my love is like a river 
that will never end 
my love is like a dove 
with a beautiful message to send  
my love is like a song 
that goes on and on forever 
my love is like a prisoner 
it 's to you that i surrender  
love 
love is like a lump of gold 
hard to get  and hard to hold  
of all the girls i 've ever met 
you 're the one i ca n't forget  
i do believe that god above 
created you for me to love  
he chose you from all the rest 
because he knew i would love you best  
i thought love was just a mirage of the mind 
it 's an illusion  it 's fake  impossible to find  
but the day i met you  i began to see 
that love is real  and exists in me  
pledge of love 
i 've made a vow  to no one but you 
i pledge my love to forever be true 
i 'll take care of you and treat you right 
i 'll lay beside you all through the night 
i 'll feed you and clothe you and keep you warm 
i 'll hug you and kiss you and give shelter in the storm 
i 'll help you and guide you and clear a path 
i 'll protect you and shield you from an angry man 's wrath 
i 'll listen to your problems help you solve them too 
i 'll make you a rainbow and let the sun shine through 
i 'll take your side even if you 're wrong 
just to prove our love is strong 
i 'll plant you flowers and make them grow 
they 'll be a symbol of love that only we 'll know 
i 'll whisper your name when no one is near 
so low that only you can hear 
you 'll feel my love even if we 're apart 
you 'll know that we are one in heart 
perfection in my eyes 
all i ever wanted was to be part of your heart 
and for us to be together  to never be apart  
no one else in the world can even compare 
you 're perfect and so is this love that we share  
we have so much more than i ever thought we would 
i love you more than i ever thought i could  
i promise to give you all i have to give 
i 'll do anything for you as long as i live  
in your eyes i see our present  our future and past 
by the way you look at me i know we will last  
i hope that one day you 'll come to realize 
how perfect you are when seen through my eyes  
there is a dime a dozen 
then there is one in a million 
but baby  you are once in a lifetime  
a path winding across the horizon 
over mountains  across seas 
through blue skies and gray 
never ceasing  continuous  
my love for you  
day by day 
night by night 
kiss by kiss 
touch by touch 
step by step 
i fall in love 
a love so incomprehensible 
so vivid 
so unique 
so wild  that not even the reign of god could control 
a passion so deep 
a need so necessary 
a want so strong 
the universe would not handle 
i love you today 
i’ll love you tomorrow 
i’ll love you forever 
for the first time 
into my world 
of darkness and silence 
you brought light and music  
when you lit my candle 
i began to see and understand 
the taste and texture of love  
for the first time  
i asked god 
i asked god for a flower  he gave me a bouquet 
i asked god for a minute  he gave me a day 
i asked god for true love  he gave me that too 
i asked for an angel and he gave me you  
dreams 
i dream of your touch while you are away 
i dream of your smile all through the day 
i remember the day 
you came into my life 
i dream of the day i will be your wife  
i dream of the day i can fall asleep next to you 
i dream of the day i can say i do  
to be your wife 
to be together for life 
is a dream i have 
every night  
my sweetheart 
so often when i am embracing you 
it seems that you exist in this world 
only because of me and i exist because of you  
it 's not easy to wander in this world 
and not lose one 's way 
but the greatest happiness of all 
is in giving joy to one 's beloved  
and if the king can have his throne 
and if the bird can have his spring nest 
and god can have his heaven 
then i  my sweetheart  i can have you  
as long as you 're near 
the first time we met  i could see 
that you and i  were meant to be  
your eyes were so gentle  your smile so true 
when you first held my hand  i just knew  
now the time has gone by  through laughter and tears 
these days i shall cherish  for years upon years  
those memories we have  shall never fade 
for those are the steps  that we have made  
that was the past  the future is near 
i anxiously wait  for what will appear  
new homes  more laughter  and children so dear 
everything will be wonderful  as long as you 're near  
motionless 
if time could stand still  i’d freeze it here 
so you’d always hold me  close and near  
in your arms  where i’m meant to be 
filled with the perfect love you’ve given me  
a bond so strong  a hold so tight 
to know you’re the one  my ‘mr right’  
a blessing sent from up above 
in you i’ve found my one true love  
our lives entwined to be as one 
upon this journey we’ve just begun  
where you and i will find no less 
than eternal love and happiness  
about you 
your touch is with me always 
it’s burnt into my skin 
as soft and warm as sun rays 
when a summer day sets in  
your soft voice never silent 
it’s forever in my ears 
serenading every moment 
and calming all my fears  
your arms always enfold me 
the strength of angels wings 
they support and protect me wholly 
with the safety a true love brings  
while i can never repay you 
for the wonder you bring to my life 
i can forever be true 
and forever be a true wife  
for paul 
i love the way you touch me 
so soft and sensuously  
it makes me tingle all over  
i love the way you kiss me  
it starts a fire deep down inside of me 
and makes me yearn for you even more  
i love the way you look at me  
it makes me feel beautiful and treasured  
most of all i love the way you love me  
when you walk in my whole day gets better  
and even when you 're not with me 
you 're in my thoughts always  
it does n't matter what we do n't have or what we do have  
the most important thing is we have each other 
and no one can take that away  
i am the luckiest woman in the world 
and i do n't need or want anything 
but you beside me loving me to the end of our days  
you are my forever love 
your friendship and love 
and all the wonderful things 
that they bring into my life 
are like nothing else 
i have ever known  
my heart is complete 
with the love we share 
and our love grows more 
beautiful each day  
i love you 
and as long as we are together 
i have everything i need  
you are with me always 
in a smile  a memory  a feeling 
or a moment we share  
you will always be 
my forever love 
you are poetry 
you come outside 
to view the faint sunset 
light bewildered by trees 
shines through quietly 
you glide your soft auburn hair 
perched behind your ear 
and in this moment i feel at home 
beneath the interior 
you are my humble abode 
your company is soothing 
calming and reassuring 
inside  the wind chimes ring 
you saunter and my hearts sings 
bit by bit i begin to recognize 
the enchanting glow in your subtle eyes 
hidden in all abstract paintings 
it’s you  what all artists see 
you are poetry 
i love you 
i love you with a permanence 
that endures the passing years  
i love you with a joyfulness 
that subdues all doubts and fears  
i love you with an honesty 
that was born within my heart  
i love you with the calm belief 
that we will never part  
i love you with a confidence 
no earthly force can sever  
i love you with the certainty 
that i’ll cherish you forever  
i love you with the humbleness 
of one who has been blessed  
i love you with the reverence 
of all that word suggests  
i love you with a fervor 
that time can not reverse  
i love you with the truest love 
that poets put to verse  
soul like the vastest sea 
your soul is like the vastest sea 
and mine a darting fish: 
i lose myself within your love  
i live within your heart  
i breathe your love : it is my air 
my element  my world  
i know no other ambiance  
i have no other dream  
i know there is outside your love 
a world of rocks and sand  
and i could live there  too  but oh  
how poor and thin each breath  
how rich my world  how beautiful 
alive within your love 
each moment filled with dancing light 
refracted through your eyes  
i love you like i love a day 
when everything goes right 
i love you like i love to lay 
and watch the stars at night 
i love you like i love the rain 
its lustful calm embrace 
i love you like i love to laugh 
until it hurts my face 
i love you like i love to drive 
with no real destination 
i love you like i love the thrill 
of pure infatuation 
but most of all i love you like 
i love a cherished friend 
who holds me tight  dries my tears 
and loves me to the end 
sunshine 
when i wake up in the morning 
sunshine 's falling on my skin 
and i call you up to tell you 
what a happy mood i 'm in 
feel the rhythm in my body 
and sing is all i wan na do 
i feel the day will bring me sunshine 
for it 's another day with you 
if there 's 
if there 's one face i want to see 
so beautiful  so true 
one smile that makes a difference 
to everything i do  
if there 's one touch i long to feel 
one voice i long to hear 
whenever i am happy 
or just needing someone near  
if there 's one joy  one love 
from which i never want to part 
it 's you  my very special love 
my world  my life  my heart  
dance me to the end of love 
dance with me in love 
dance with me in life 
when did enduring love begin  
the day we became man and wife 
there is patience and understanding 
we try to be unselfish and kind 
though not a fairy-tale romance 
no greater love will we find 
sharing dreams  passions  and desires 
building each other up when we fall 
we 've learned to say i 'm sorry 
and i love you through it all 
our two hearts beat as one 
cherishing what we have from above 
dance with me forever 
dance me to the end of love 
red rose 
our love is that of a red rose 
whose splendor rises as the sun shows its face 
whose petals expand further and richer 
whispering secrets of happiness and affection  
and even though with the fall of dusk 
all contentment is swept away 
and the rose 's petals unite as one 
reflecting any light that may endeavor to shine through 
the sun will always rise 
and the rose 's petals will eternally broaden 
until they fully blossom into a stunning creation  
our love is that of a red rose 
possessing a few imperfections 
that may cause evanescent wounds 
but the internal radiance 
that will everlastingly bestow healing and comfort  
the golden path 
take my hand this way we 'll go 
said the man above 
i 'll take you to a place of joy 
where you will find true love 
if you let go  go on your own 
but mistakes you will make 
for many other ways there are 
which you are sure to take 
when you feel that you are lost 
all you have to do is pray 
and i 'll be there once again 
to help you on your way 
i did pray and just as said 
he shined his light from above 
that showed me the way down the golden path 
that led me to your love  
to lay a kiss on your lips 
so gentle and delicate 
is like picking the drops of dew 
off the petals of a rose  
i hold you close and feel safe 
sheltered in from the rain 
from the storms that grow and surround me  
i take your hand and look into your eyes 
and see a heart made of gold and soul so pure  
you see you are an angel  an angel to me  
i could not help but fall madly in love with you 
the one who stole my heart  
i’m glad you did 
because i could never find one such as you 
some one who makes each day the best 
each laugh the longest 
each tear the saddest 
and a life  my life  worthwhile  
poem for sharon 
why is it that some people who find love 
handle it with such carelessness  
some people search for love all their lives  
when it is found  why put it down and forget about it 
only to realize how much it meant when it is gone  
when you find love  hold on to it 
celebrate its feelings 
drown in them every day 
be consumed by them 
i am consumed by you sharon  
i will never set aside my love  
i will never look for it only when it is lost  
i love you  
i will show you and tell you every day  
`` yes  ' 
my joy is overflowing 
you got down on your knee 
and have professed forever 
your special love for me  
there was no hesitation 
the moment i said `` yes  ' 
and gave life to the feelings 
i 'm longing to express  
i give myself completely 
my heart belongs to you  
i 'm counting every moment 
until we say `` i do  ' 
you are the perfect person 
to compliment my life  
there 'll be no brighter day than 
when i become your wife  
you came into my life unexpectedly 
and everything took a turn for the better  
your warm eyes  your laugh 
the sincere way you speak 
and the kindness you showed me 
all became a part of my life  
as you unfolded yourself to me 
i discovered more and more beauty  
i have never seen so much 
gentleness in one person  
without even knowing it 
you were slowly making a place 
for yourself in my heart  
it used to seem so hard at times 
to feel so close in a relationship  
but it’s so easy to feel close to you  
i can’t tell you how nice that feels  
i realize now that i had never known 
what it meant to be loved 
until i was loved by you  
a love like no other 
i never felt a love 
like this before 
it 's a love like no other 
something i have always hoped for 
a love with friendship 
humour and heart 
a bond so strong 
it would never part 
a love that makes you smile 
from ear to ear 
a love that is joyful 
without any fear 
a love that is beautiful 
from the inside out 
a love with no tears 
pain  or doubt 
a love with soul 
so tender and true 
a love that i have found 
only in you 
as i look outside i see the breeze 
caress the leaves from the trees 
and carry them to all around 
gently laid upon the ground 
i see the birds so high above 
their songs sing of our special love 
and laid upon their soft sweet wing 
your love to me they gently bring 
and as they start their graceful descent 
delivering a message that’s heaven sent 
one thing i know and will hold so dear 
when i see them fly i will feel you near 
deep as the rose is red 
i 'll give you my heart  i 'll open it up 
will you listen to its small still voice  
for soft and quiet my heart will speak 
to the one i 'll call my wife  
did you hear it dear  did you listen well  
do you understand what it said  
for deep is the love that it speaks to you 
deep as the rose is red  
so  take my heart and treat it well 
and forever in this life 
come walk with me  your hand in mine 
the one i 'll call my wife  
onto the sea 
i sailed my boat 
and prayed that it 
would stay afloat 
from dawn til dusk 
from dusk til dawn 
in search of love 
i drifted on 
what happened then 
i do n't recall 
i think it was 
a sudden squall 
for when i awoke 
i thought i died 
at the sight of an angel 
at my side 
but lucky for me 
that was not true 
for i found love 
and love was you  
feelings 
as i wake by your side 
my feelings for you i can not hide 
i touch your face in the morning light 
being with you just feels so right 
you make me feel like i 'm a queen 
like being inside an awesome dream 
although this is real  that i know 
as the love that surrounds us continues to grow 
i think of what the future holds 
marriage  children  us growing old 
and as i lay  with you dear 
i 'm just so glad you 're mine  you 're here  
my eyes beheld a sky one night 
it seems so long ago 
a perfectly painted portrait 
be-speckled with blue and gold  
as i sit and ponder more 
it strikes me that you were there 
and it was truly your simple beauty 
that gave the stars their perfect glare  
beauty 
your lips  your eyes  your soul 
are like a work of art 
the most creative thing of all 
is your beautiful heart  
if you were a painting 
no colours could express 
the beauty deep inside you 
a rainbow  nothing less  
if you were a sculpture 
the clay could hardly make 
your figure of an angel 
without one mistake  
if you were a euphony 
no choir could really sing 
all the beautiful music 
your eyes could possibly bring  
so here i am  an artist 
with inspiration beyond belief 
but to capture such rare beauty 
i 'd have to be a thief  
a patchwork quilt 
made up of memories of you 
bound together with love 
sewn with your selfless giving 
threads made of grace 
lined with thoughts of you  
squares made of days gone by 
days we spent together 
each with a new design 
of the things that we shared  
blanket stitches of our hearts 
mingle the squares in rows 
nothing can tear it apart 
not fire or flood or anything close  
it’s kept in a place of my keeping 
the treasure chest of my heart 
wrapped in tissue of forgiveness 
and tied with ribbons of love  
the colors all speak of you 
pinks and blues and other hues 
sewn tight and fastened together 
with hope and faith and truth  
from now until forever 
i’ve never known a love like yours 
nor thought it could be true 
but every time i kiss your lips 
i feel what love can do 
with hair like silk 
and lips so tender 
each moment with you 
makes my heart surrender 
i couldn’t live  i couldn’t breathe 
without you by my side 
never will i let you go 
my love will never hide 
and in my heart you’ll always be 
from now until forever 
no matter what  no matter where 
we’ll always be together 
one year of happiness 
one year of holding hands 
one year of hugging 
one year of laughing 
one year of cuddling  
one year of loving 
one year of kissing 
one year of touching 
one year of romancing  
one year of your love 
one year of my love 
one year of our love 
one year of true love  
baby one year with you 
is a year of happiness 
a year of passion 
a year of joy 
a year blessed  
when all the songs are over 
and all the words been said 
the sun grows dim across the sky 
and the world prepares for bed 
i oft can take a moment now 
to view the sky above 
and whisper god a simple prayer 
to thank him for your love 
the curve of your hips 
is stuck in my mind 
the taste of your lips 
so sweet that i find 
myself lost in the thought 
of our next embrace 
i see now i 'm caught 
without even a chase 
i love your love 
i love your dark eyes 
and your curly hair 
i love your smile 
and the way that you care  
i love your deep kisses 
i love your soft touch 
i love you  i love you 
i love you so much  
the way you make me feel 
you make me feel special 
you make me feel new 
you make me feel loved 
with everything you do  
you hold me close when i am sad  
you wipe the tears from my face  
every time we are together 
it seems like the perfect place  
my eyes light up when you enter a room  
i smile when we are together  
no matter how bad things are 
you always make them better  
i love the way you kiss me 
the way you hold me tight  
i love the way you touch me 
i could be with you all night  
i love the way you can make me laugh 
for absolutely no reason at all  
i love how no matter what i do 
you will be there to catch me when i fall  
i just want you to know 
that even though we sometimes fight 
i will always love you  
no matter what  day or night  
when we danced 
soft gentle stare 
warm tender touch 
you took my hand 
and we danced 
arms around me 
light dragging moves 
cheek warm against mine 
breathing deep from the soul 
long have i searched 
finally i have found 
when you took my hand 
and we danced 
the web 
creatively 
you worked your art 
you spun a web 
around my heart 
how beautifully 
your deeds have spread 
each intricately 
woven thread 
with strands of care 
you dried my tears 
your gentleness 
dispelled my fears 
your wisdom 
helped me understand 
and patiently 
you held my hand 
to give me courage 
to brave the storm 
with kindness 
you have kept me warm 
your passion 
lit a glowing fire 
that filled my soul 
with sweet desire 
you 're all 
that i was dreaming of 
for the web you spun 
was made of love 
our sonnet 
sweet lady  song of my heart 
hold my hand  as this journey we start  
lift me up in spirit of joy and gladness  
and shield my soul from heartbreak and sadness  
steadfast  honest and true  
your partner is here and will forever love you  
it is my prayer that i will always be  
the one who brings you joy and sets your spirit free  
with my love i’ll cover you and warm your soul with mine  
give you pleasures – like none you will find  
your sweet lady  song of your heart  
will love you forever  together or apart  
so hear me sweet lady  and know in your soul  
that there is no better future than with you to grow old  
endless caresses  touches and kisses  
our passion a banner for our love’s true existence  
my hand i extend and my honor i offer  
for being with you my love  there is no greater pleasure  
your hand i accept  and all your love as well  
my heart sings so loudly  all can tell 
i am loved and in love with the man made for me 
hold my hand  let us walk through this life 
being what we were meant to be 
together  
one special night 
as i sit here gazing out the window 
instead of working  i’m daydreaming of you 
and wondering if while you’re in your own world 
you’re thinking of me too  
i reminisce about the day we met and how you made me feel 
looking at the glowing smile on your face 
staring into your dreamy blue eyes 
your smell  your touch  your warm embrace 
what a special night that was 
and now  i’m starting to feel that warmth inside 
like nothing or no one else can make me feel 
butterflies  a constant smile  happy thoughts 
looking forward to the next time we meet  
what lies ahead  down the road to love  
can it possibly be what i’ve been hoping for  
all my goals  dreams  passions  hopes 
glaring now before me with great anticipation  
no one knows what tomorrow brings 
one can only wish and believe 
i have abounding faith that god will take care of me 
and bring the right person into my life  
could it be you  
time will tell 
i feel a special bond starting between us 
and so i’m truly hopeful that it is ( you )  
when i first looked into your eyes 
when first i looked into your eyes 
each breath became a thousand sighs  
my heart drummed out a thunder beat 
i glowed with joy from head to feet  
the hand of love had touched my soul 
as the bell of destiny began to toll  
the tide of love began to rise 
the world was filled with summer skies  
my sodden clouds of cold and grey 
glowed with gold  then wisped away  
a brilliant rainbow arched across 
as waves of love began to toss  
the air was filled with lovebird cries 
when i first looked into your eyes  
when i first looked into your eyes 
all time and space were paralyzed 
and in that instant  i was shown 
a universe i had never known  
i dwell there still  in paradise 
when i look into your eyes  
everytime i look at the stars 
i gazed in your eyes 
such a beautiful blue  
my heart whispered to me 
and that’s right when i knew  
the waves had ceased crashing 
on the sand at our feet  
time had stopped passing 
my search was complete  
i finally discovered 
what i 'd known all along  
a mystery uncovered 
that just could n't be wrong  
it was n't our first kiss 
nor  the day that we met  
but i realized something 
i will never forget  
with the stars shining brightly 
from high up above  
i 'd one word to describe it 
that word  is love  
i knew then these feelings 
for my sweetheart were true  
the man of my dreams 
and my soulmate  is you  
i think of it every time 
that i look at the stars  
this memory is mine 
but that moment was 
ours  
you are more than love to me 
you are everything  
dreaming 
i used to dream of eyes so blue 
and loving arms to hold me  
i used to dream of heroic knights 
and how gracious they would be  
i used to dream of how i wouldn’t settle 
for anything less than best  
i used to dream of how he would majestically 
lay all fears to rest  
i used to dream of fairy tales 
how wondrous would they be 
i used to dream of story books 
all patterned after me  
i used to dream of a lot of things 
but the moment i met you 
i immediately stopped dreaming 
because all of my dreams came true  
sun rise 
the grey began to fade 
as the colours filled the sky 
the chill began to warm 
as the sun began to rise  
a lost girl found direction 
as the eastern orb rose high 
the dark sky turned to blue 
like the colour of his eyes  
dark turned to light 
grey turned to blue 
lost became found 
that 's when i met you  
love spell 
every time i look at you 
my heart skips a beat 
i wonder if you know  my love 
that my heart is at your feet 
i leave it there for you to do 
whatever that you wish 
you could take my heart 
and love me 
or just leave me in this bliss  
cinderella 
i’m standing on the stairs in a magnificent hall 
wearing the dress that i bought for the ball 
it’s long and flowing  sparkling white 
my tiara of diamonds shines in the light 
at the bottom of the stairs you’re waiting for me 
and i gracefully float down for all to see 
you take my hand and touch my face 
you’re the only one i notice in the expansive space 
we’re now dancing in shadows of flickering light 
holding each other close  holding each other tight 
you kiss my neck and then touch my face 
then kiss my lips in a loving embrace 
time stands still whilst we are together 
feels so good  it seems like forever 
i look at the clock  that can not be right 
but the bells start to chime  confirming midnight 
but there’s no need to leave 
from the ball tonight 
i’ll be with you my prince 
for the rest of our life  
you 
you kissed my lips and i felt a flutter in my heart 
you touched my hand and lit a spark in my body 
you stared into my eyes and saw straight into my soul 
you put your arms around me and i was finally complete  
all i need 
your love surrounds me like the air that i breathe  
your kiss touches me as gentle as a breeze  
your touch is as tender as that of a child  
your hug is warm  meek  and mild  
each day we grow older and its plain to see 
the love that you give me is all that i need  
words twist and tumble 
through my mind 
but i ca n't grab the right word 
or the right line 
so we sit 
in silence 
but it’s not uncomfortable 
in fact i love it 
you rest your head on my chest 
as we lay here 
lovers entwined 
hearts tangled 
you raise your head 
and look into my eyes 
and i see our love 
almost as if it’s a real force 
i don’t ever want to lose this moment 
you lay your head on my chest once again 
and now i can feel your heartbeat 
and my hearts skips 
and i finally find the words i’m looking for 
i love you 
every second beat 
if i had a thousand pages 
i could never name them all 
the reasons that i love you 
for the list would be too tall  
i love you for the melody 
i hear within your voice  
the way your blue eyes hold me 
a captive  but by choice  
i love you for your gentle hands 
that melt away my pain  
i love you for your loving heart 
that made mine beat again  
i love you for your loving smile 
with which my old heart soars  
these are some of the reasons 
every second beat is yours  
in love 
the day you appeared i lost my heart 
to you  to love  
and from that day i can not part 
from you  from love  
you hold me tight 
to you  to love  
in my thoughts all day and night 
of you  of love  
i offer all that i have to give 
to you  to love  
and all my days i want to live 
with you  in love  
inside of me 
if you could see inside my soul 
see inside my heart 
you would know how i long for you 
whenever we 're apart 
if you could see inside my head 
if thoughts were things to see 
you would know how i cherish you 
how much you mean to me 
in all the ways you comfort me 
the way you hold me near 
the way you know just what to do 
to chase away my fear 
the sparkle in your beautiful eyes 
your smile  laugh  your touch 
are just a few of many reasons 
i love you oh so much 
knowing i can talk to you 
about any and everything 
and knowing together we will get 
through whatever life may bring 
i could search the whole world over 
and this i know is true 
i would never find another love 
like the love i found with you 
though with each new day  each sunrise 
we ca n't know what 's in store 
there is one thing i know for sure 
each day i love you more 
so if you could see inside my head 
if thoughts were things to see 
you would know i blessed i feel 
to have you here with me 
you are my heart  my soul  my treasure 
my today  my tomorrow  my forever 
my everything  
bliss 
your eyes  your smile  
your touch  your kiss  
your promise  your words  
our everlasting bliss  
in your eyes 
i see .. me  
key to my heart 
i had closed the door upon my heart 
and would n't let anyone in 
i had trusted and loved only to be hurt 
but  that would never happen again  
i had locked the door and tossed the key 
as hard  and as far as i could 
love would never enter there again 
my heart was closed for good  
then you came into my life 
and made me change my mind 
just when i thought that tiny key 
was impossible to find  
that 's when you held out your hand 
and proved to me i was wrong 
inside your palm was the key to my heart 
you had it all along  
it 's been years 
it’s been years since we first met 
since we looked into each other 's eyes 
not realizing that we were meant to be together 
it 's been years since we shared our first laugh 
our first smile 
since we shared our first kiss 
i remember how strong your arms embraced me 
how soft you held me 
how warm and gentle you were 
i remember how passionate that first kiss was 
now my heart is dancing 
happy  knowing that it 's been years 
it 's been years since we first met 
and you 're still here kissing me just the same 
you 're still here holding me just the same 
what i felt for you is still the same 
it 's been years 
and that feeling will never change 
whispers in the wind 
your whispers are gentle echoes 
that sway ardent winds of harmony 
and in the symphony of life 
each word is wrapped in rhapsody  
we travel separate roads of life 
gather flowers along the way and 
share the music of their fragrance  
we exist between two winds 
i here under a pale moon 
you  the other end of somewhere  
sometimes when wind blows through trees 
i pause to listen and in its passing 
i hear the tenderness of your voice 
that fills the spectrum of my soul  
you are the chime of warm rain 
the moon that glows through the trees 
and within the luster of evening 
your aura fills the scene  
i hear the whispers of the wind 
see the stars shine in the sky 
but i hold the sunrise in my pocket  
dance with me within the wind 
then just let me love you  
believe 
what is there 
to believe in during life 
nothing lasts 
aside from strife 
life may perish 
life may end 
our soul we may give 
our soul we may spend 
but our love 
that eternal flame 
will never dim 
will never change 
it will forever last 
when all other lights leave 
for you light my life 
you make me believe  
a perfect moment 
beautiful eyes open across a pillow top 
it seems for this moment time will stop 
the earth slows and sounds wane 
a frozen moment without stain  
your body close to mine 
our hearts beat in time 
with a smile of simple pleasure 
this moment should last forever  
some say perfection is unattainable 
for most things that 's explainable 
but in your arms and with your heart 's affection 
i have found a brief moment of perfection  
freeze this moment 
we were sitting on your rooftop 
staring at the skies 
the sun was dipping lower 
i looked into your eyes 
you saw what i was feeling 
i know you felt it too 
we wanted time to just stand still 
then forever there 'd be me and you 
why ca n't we freeze this moment  
return to it in time 
stay together through the years 
proclaim i 'm yours and you are mine 
so let us freeze this moment 
store it safely away 
even if we leave this place 
we 'll return to it someday 
your essence  your being 
just takes me away 
back to a time way back  
back when charming princes 
in shining armor  on white horses 
flourished  their swords 
making the princesses swoon  
you do that to me 
make me laugh  and fret 
and swoon  on occasion  
but without a sword 
or a great white horse 
or armor 
you are still a prince  
and my prince 
whom i 'd swoon over 
any day  
my vow to you 
i know you 're going crazy 
i 've been there too  
i can see how the weight is making your knees bend 
let me take some of it from you  
do n't keep yourself closed off 
i am here for you to open up and let go  
there is so much you ca n't forget or forgive 
let me help you cope  we can work things out together  
i hear the pain in your voice 
you need me now  
do n't worry  i 'll move heaven and hell to get there  
you ca n't talk  you wo n't talk about it 
i understand  
put your worries in my hands  
lay your head down 
and believe that i will do anything to stop your tears  
you 're ready to give up  you 've stopped 
i want to be able to give you the strength to keep going  
link arms with me  let 's move on 
as one living  breathing  loving  being  
know that you can put faith in me  
i will be your rock  i will be your dwelling 
i am here with you  for you always  
when i saw your eyes 
when you came to your door tonight 
and your beautiful eyes gazed at me 
from the darkness within 
the world around me came to a stop 
for just a few seconds 
as i saw the love from within you  
you looked at me with your warm smile 
your black hair around your face 
and whispered softly  `` hi baby '  
and once again 
i was at your mercy  
for when you look into my soul 
and i hear the sound of your sweet voice 
my heart opens to you my love 
with all of my dreams now fulfilled  
i never knew that a love like this 
could ever exist 
a love that consumes me 
a love so powerful 
and so overwhelming 
that i fear if i were without it 
my heart would no longer have a meaning 
to its existence 
for the love that flows through it now 
is what keeps me alive 
keeps me whole  
as i gaze into your eyes my love 
down into the depths of your very being 
i can see the love you feel for me 
a love as strong as my own 
a love that fills me so full of emotion 
so full of hope for the future 
that i pray i will spend the rest of my days 
gazing into your eyes  
young love 
love is patient  love is kind 
and what our loves express is true  
no amount of tragedy can tear 
or break the love i have for you  
time has healed our many wounds 
but has not erased the memory  
but we 'll hold on  we 'll stay together  
we will get through this  you and me  
though we are young and still learning 
about ourselves  our world today 
in my heart  i 'll always love you 
and in my heart you 'll always stay  
as days go by  as time progresses 
we will change  mature  and always grow  
but as we grow  as we reminisce 
there is one thing i will always know  
my love for you will never falter 
never cease  for it 's always true  
with love comes patience  but it 's worth the wait 
to share my unending love with you  
you leave me wanting nothing more 
than wanting more of you  
awakening 
that morning whisper 
a gentle kiss 
a suspended moment 
of perfect bliss 
that precious feeling 
as eyes first meet 
bodies entwined 
in sleepy heat 
fingers touching 
breath as one 
hearts in rhythm 
we greet the sun 
content  in truth 
just to be 
simply enjoying 
you and me 
one fateful day 
no river 's span is quite as vast 
no mountain 's reach so high  
no rose 's scent is quite as sweet 
as the love i hold inside  
every time i see your face and 
every time you smile 
every time i kiss your lips 
my love grows all the while 
i’m the luckiest man to walk the earth 
to know a love like yours 
loving is so easy now 
you’ve opened my heart’s doors  
and i 'll love you 'til my life has ceased 
and still more with my soul 
because that fateful day we met 
my heart you forever stole  
a heart remembers 
a memory burned within  from a heartfelt second long ago 
a moment .. one single moment  that only a heart can remember 
a fleeting thought  gone astray  but the feeling looms inside you 
a boy and a girl .. so far apart  so long the days 
that it took their hearts to remind them 
how fortunate they are  that a heart 
can return a fleeting thought 
one single moment  or a memory burned within 
so they can now live as one 
as only inside true love  can such a past remain 
until .. it 's found again 
love letter 
a fire that is carefully stoked and tended will not burn out  
it will blaze so brightly that its warmth lingers in your heart  
it will beckon your tired soul and embrace you in its radiance  
the familiar smell of its smoke can bring a wistful smile 
and the occasional blast of fireworks can take your breath away  
its sizzle can enthrall you  its flickering flames entrance you  
the glowing embers provide comforting heat 
and the knowledge that a subtle movement or gentle breeze 
can rekindle a bonfire  
my love  the spark that ignited the day we met 
remains an eternal flame  
blessed 
how blessed i am that you are in my life 
not a day goes by when i do not think of you 
you make everything alright 
to you i do not have to prove myself 
for you know me 
i love you 
how blessed i am that you are in my life 
how honoured i am to be a part of yours 
memories made and shared 
with you the one i love 
my friend  my lover  my queen 
'til the end 
it 's perfect  and touches me deep 
first thing in the morning  when i hear you speak 
and last thing at night as you bid me sweet dreams 
the brush of your lips lets me know what you mean 
and all of the hours that pass through the day 
those spent together and when you 're away 
i think of you always  imagine your touch 
think how to show you  i love you so much 
so when we 're apart  and you long for me near 
just try to remember  you 're already here 
for deep in my heart  where no one can see 
you 'll be forever  together we 'll be 
saying i do 
saying i do 
is more than saying i love you 
it goes beyond describing how my love is true 
because words are not enough to express my love for you  
saying i do 
is like saying i am here for you 
that i am ready to see what the future may bring 
because we are together in everything  
saying i do 
is saying i am now complete because of you 
that the pieces of the puzzle called `` my life ' 
becomes a beautiful picture called `` our love '  
and now i am saying `` i do ' 
as i walk down the aisle with you 
this is a lifetime promise that i will hold 
a promise i make until we grow old  
maria 
how long can you keep up that face  
how many times tonight will your lips unfurl to a smile  
how can you work in this place concealing such grace  
how would you like to leave with me .. and see the world for a while  
hang up your apron and baggy jeans for this little number 
come dance with me through the night until morning light 
laughing and singing through streets wrapt in slumber 
your soft ebony eyes reflecting an italian moon  so magnificently bright  
let me take your hand  oh this night we set sail 
on a thrilling journey to a remote place called love 
making memories and writing our own midnight tale 
a side by side silhouette  diamond-set dark velvet above  
without even trying  you emit beauty  passion and elegance 
from your slender model figure to your lush flowing hair 
dancing in the wind  my heart shocked by your electric radiance 
the breath-taking waitress  mi manchi tanto maria  
missing treasure 
the missing treasure of this sinking vessel 
on the seafloor  where it would nestle 
against the base for years it 'd lay 
patiently waiting for that special day 
when i would come to claim my prize 
hoping the chest to my surprise 
would hold the heart that i 've been missing 
the talks  the laughs  the hugs  the kissing 
that day has come and now i 'll find 
what lies ahead  no longer behind 
i 've searched through darkness  to the deepest sea 
and found that chest staring back at me 
what lies inside  i do not know 
unlock the latch and open slow 
i peek within  with nerves i 'm shaking 
the prize inside could stop the aching 
cause within the chest that i 've searched for 
i found the heart and even more 
the talks  the laughs  they all were there 
the hugs  the kisses  for me to share 
the most beautiful treasure i 've finally seized 
did not imagine i could be so pleased 
i searched so long through the deep sea blue 
i love you baby  my prize is you 
thank you 
the sun sets 
upon the golden sand 
we sit together 
hand in hand 
we gently embrace 
and look into each other 's eyes 
i wonder if you are 
an angel in disguise 
you hold me 
like there 's no tomorrow 
i suddenly forget 
the past sorrow 
i kiss your soft lips 
and you kiss mine 
i never knew 
loving someone could be this fine 
you pick me up 
and carry me to our room 
oh how a love can blossom 
and a heart can bloom  
your touch is so gentle 
but your hands so strong 
how could a love like this 
ever go wrong  
my heart is beating 
200 times a minute 
because my love 
you are in it 
the sound of your heartbeat 
all through the night 
we fall asleep in each other 's arms 
and wake to the morning light  
i look into your eyes 
and this is when 
i say `` thank you ' 
for teaching me to love again  
once i was a beautiful shell 
giving life to the creatures of the sea 
tides and time pounded on me  breaking me bit by bit 
then i was stuck nowhere to go 
the barnacles found a place to dwell 
but mother ocean gave me a second chance 
the tides washed me upon the shore 
there i lay waiting in the sun  dull and chipped and ugly 
then  you came along and found me 
the barnacles were picked  the sand washed off 
you polished me up and brought out my luster 
i 'm still chipped with imperfections 
but you laid me out for everyone to see 
the beautiful colors inside me 
now i 'm shiny with colors and gold 
the tides have yet to see me grow old 
with the tenderness and care you gave me 
i am once again a beautiful shell 
courting cambria 
autumn eyes stare out at me 
silky locks of burnished brown 
poise  elegance and aristocracy 
statuesque  splendor  and magnificence 
all words pale 
all words fail 
to bind the beautiful cambria 
beauty be not lonely 
virtue is her friend 
gentle  sweet  with wits abound 
her voice so sweet  has songbird sound 
yet the lexicon pales 
the language fails 
to bespeak beguiling cambria  
i 'd cross not mountains for her 
i 'd move them one by one  
i 'd walk not burning sands 
instead i 'd seed her lands  
her world would fill with statues 
and gardens at her feet  
these things i say would happen 
each time we came to meet  
she makes a man become a man 
makes him strive for more  
she makes him wish for worthiness 
remake his very core  
thus i pay my homage 
poetic tribute not mere prose  
i give to her this piece of me 
and not some dying rose  
like a rose 
my love for you is like a red  red rose 
it started as a seed but it’s grown and grown  
its roots reach deep down inside of my chest 
and it grows even more with each passing breath  
the delicate petals lay beautiful and pure 
all the doubts that i’ve had you have since cured  
for all the thorns that this proud rose bears 
they are all softened by the thought of your care  
soon the rose grows old and withers and dies 
but the love that helped grow it will last for all time  
my love  my heart  my soul is my gift to you 
your smile  your love is the only reward i would want 
precious  like a gem made by angels to shine forever 
releasing the passion inside me that burns for you 
intertwining our destinies  so that we two soul mates 
now and forever  can live out our hopes and dreams 
creating our own bond of life  to overcome the challenges 
explore the mysteries  and to enjoy life as it should be 
sharing the peace and love  that everyone looks for 
so in the end i want nothing  because i have everything i need 
near you 
'neath velvet cloth of night and shadows 
my heart confessed its thoughts to the wind  
i could feel your smile from a distance 
with the touch of your closeness profound  
the sun reached behind a fading sky 
so the moon could take its proper place  
day to darkness  brightened by the stars 
leaving upon the blue waters 
a shimmering portrait of your face  
you  with all your savoring sweetness 
tenderly pierced the walls of my soul 
as you wove a new tapestry with 
the golden threads of your hope and love  
yesterday you offered me courage 
today you endowed me with your strength  
every moment together  a gift  
every day a celebration of life  
how lovely the music of your heart  
you are the air i breathe  sound i hear 
and the spirit that gently moves me  
i do n't wish for the moon  i have the stars  
beauty beyond memory 
when memories cry 
when memories fade and die 
i 'm going to grow old 
my passion 
my fiery passion 
my flaming lust is going to grow cold 
but my heart will always flow with a molten  love lava 
in your name this lava flows through my veins 
my heart beats for you 
my heart will never cease to beat your name 
when i lose my charm and my glamour 
when i lose my physique and my game 
when i 'm old and wrinkly 
when i can not look myself in the mirror 
i 'll still stare at you 
when memories fade 
when i forget the days of the week 
and the months of the year 
when i mix names 
and faces 
the memory of you 
will always shine bright and clear 
your image 
has been burnt to my memory 
i will never forget your radiance and beauty 
i will die happy 
with the image of your sweet smile 
on my mind 
and love 
on my lips and in my heart 
i make this solemn promise to you: 
to be your lover when you need to be loved 
your doctor when you are ill 
your army when you go to war 
your umbrella when life rains down on you 
your rock when you get weary 
your shield when you need defense 
your spirit when you are drained 
your pillow when you need to rest 
your voice when no one can hear you 
your ear when no one will listen 
your comfort when you feel pain 
your hero when you are under duress 
your sunshine when darkness falls 
your answer when questions arise 
your inspiration to overcome obstacles 
your hand to hold when you are frightened 
your kiss that wakes you everyday 
and your `` i love you ' each and every night  
i am yours .. all of me  
breeze skipping over water 
water reflecting lights strung over the bridge 
lights shining in your eyes  
the fresh  bold feeling of something new 
as winter melts into liquid spring 
and summer takes shape and ripens alongside love  
the petals from the flowering trees  snow for the summer 
floating down around us as we kiss 
once  twice  then forever  
you aren’t just my sunshine  
you 're my sun  
when i was little 
i had a lush dream 
that one day i find 
and marry a queen  
she 'd sit by my side 
up there on our throne 
with princes and princesses 
so we 're never alone  
i can honestly say 
my dream has come true 
and you 'd never believe 
just how much i love you  
i may not be king 
and you may not be queen 
but together we 're perfect 
just like in my dream  
our love 
you hold my hand  i caress your lips 
you look into my eyes and my heart beat skips  
i stroke your back skin so soft and smooth 
i admire your face  every line  every groove  
we move in a little closer  our bodies entwine 
you touch my neck  it sends shivers down my spine  
you whisper that you love me and i know it 's true 
because i feel it in my heart and i love you too  
love does separate us ( l'amour nous sépare ) 
through all time  love has strung beautiful art 
does love now weave this vision in my heart  
have two stars been taken straight from the sky 
do they look back at me as i look into your eyes  
love does separate us in lands so far 
love does make this a trial so hard  
may i ask for one night to shrink this land 
may i have you just one night  just to reach your hand  
if my wish i may have not  let us kiss with our minds 
let our words carry us together on winds of divine  
love does separate us in lands far away 
but if love does ring true  i 'll get to you some way  
you sherry 
you are my world  
you are my life  
you are my everything  
you are my wife  
you are my best friend  
you are my lover  
you are my dreams come true  
you are my shelter  my cover  
you are my sun in the sky  
you are my moonlight at night  
you are all the good in the world  
you are all that is right  
you are all that i see  
you are all that i feel  
you are all that i need  
you are all that is real  
when it comes to lovin  couples 
do n't we make the perfect pair- 
there 's romance  love  and laughter 
in the friendship that we share  
we care enough to listen 
to trust and understand  
to build a life together 
side by side and hand in hand  
we both know that we 're lucky 
and we 've got a good thing going  
through ups and downs 
and give and take 
our love just keeps on growing 
'cause i bring out the best in you 
and you the best in me- 
i guess it takes the two of us 
to make the perfect `` we  ' 
mi canon in `` d ' 
you are my love  my life  my best chance to live free 
my eyes when i watch the sun setting over the sea 
my lungs when the cool breeze blows softly into me 
you are my ears when i listen to canon in d  
my sweetest sweet  my dearest dear 
my trust and hope and my freedom of all fears 
always my love  no matter how far or how near 
the oceans so vast as far as one can see 
under the sky so blue  beyond the mountains  highest peaks 
so far  deep and long my love for you 
so strong and lasting  so real and true 
the beauty of your eyes looking into mine 
your skin  your hair all so soft and so fine 
how lucky am i that you could be all mine  
alas my angel i have found and she has found me 
so far  far away but i still hear her heart beat 
beyond all hopes and more than any dream 
i now believe in fate and in destiny  
what you are 
you are my raft in the rapids of life 
you are my peace in the midst of strife 
you are the shore to a shipwrecked soul 
you are the bridge to a lifelong goal 
you are the finish of an olympic run 
you are the shine when there is no sun 
you are a rope when i start to fall 
you are my wife and you are my all  
the first time i laid eyes on you 
a seed was sown within me  
since then it has grown 
its creeping tendrils ensnaring my heart 
filling my head with thoughts of you  
now a fiery blossom is blooming 
radiating passion  stirring up longing  
each day with you 
these feelings grow stronger  
standing near you i am enchanted 
for i am in the presence of an angel  
no longer can these feelings be held in  
from my chest they burst outward 
in this confusion only one thing is certain  
i love you  
my roses are fresh 
their stems stand still strong  
their petals gleam red 
but time has moved on  
the roses have wilted 
their scent is all gone  
the petals are faded 
but my love will live on  
katica 
i close my eyes  and there you are  
you dazzle me  from near and far  
your silhouette - it strikes me too  
no other like it  uniquely you  
all perfect curves  from head to toe  
from hips to calves  from eyes to nose  
both inside and outside  your brilliance flows  
i crave your kiss  my heart explodes  
still strong without you  i remain  
though hard it is  each passing day  
i am bolstered too  each sunless night  
your voice i hear  turns dark to light  
i want you now  stay near to me  
eyes open wide  still you i see 
unsaid 
sometimes 
lips are sealed 
tongue is tied 
sometimes 
hands ca n't reach 
the feelings are locked 
into these eyes 
read the words unsaid 
the feelings not laid 
plunge deeply into my heart 
every time 
love is there 
love is there 
but little did i know 
i remember like it was yesterday  the day i first saw your face  
i remember your smile so vividly  your beauty and your grace  
but little did i know i could not comprehend 
that you would touch my life so much by becoming my best friend  
your hand embraced with mine  the star lit sky did see 
how  although my chest was pounding  i dropped down to one knee  
i did n't think my heart had room  for my love to grow 
there 's just no way to love you more  but how little did i know  
dressed in white  our eyes then met  standing in that sacred room  
when we both agreed to be man and wife my love for you did bloom  
i can not explain my heart just grew i 've never felt this way  
but little did i know  that i 'd love you more each day  
the memories remain  yet those days are now long past  
the time has gone so sweet and slow  but at the same time fast  
my love for you is greater now  than it ever was before  
but little do i know right now  how much i 'll love you more

three words 
fill my racing mind 
leave me breathless 
lost in time 
three words 
fill my endless dreams 
repair my heart 
mend the seams 
three words 
fill my open ears 
flutter 'pon your tongue 
wash away my dark fears 
three words 
fill my joyful life 
with you by my side 
my beautiful wife 
three words 
fill your heart too 
three words pronounced 
i love you 
oh honey  
bountiful butterflies 
superbly fluttering 
wings passionately painted 
within me they 're stirring  
such an elating buzz  
oh honey  what can it bee   
something with a sweet sting 
has flown unto me  
i remember that day when all with the world was right 
everything seemed so very  very bright 
as we travelled for hours along that winding road 
stopping here and there for photos to upload 
the autumn colours as beautiful as a sunset 
it was that very day our spirits finally met 
in a place finally free from dark subdued light 
suddenly  we were finally shining so bright 
a little overwhelming  i had said it could be 
you needed to breath  take a break from me 
and now you understand those dizzy thoughts 
the ones you created with the love you brought 
the love i hold finally to be shared 
with my friend for whom my love has been bared 
this love not to be hidden  but now open for all to see 
my heart freely given  please take all of me 
your heart too my love you gave for me to hold 
and it 's safe  deep within my hearts stronghold 
forever to be cherished and nourished 
for what a day it will be to see that heart flourish 
keep that smile upon your face my love 
and those sparkling eyes keep them looking above 
for those shooting stars that i 'll send tonight 
will keep our love pure and shining throughout the dark night 
christmas time is here again 
i wish you only knew 
how special christmas is this year 
because i am with you  
this year i do n't need any gifts 
beneath the christmas tree 
the only thing i 'll ever want 
is you to be with me 
i put you on my christmas list 
and mailed it like a kid 
but if santa did n't bring you here 
an angel surely did 
you 're my favorite gift of all 
you 've filled my heart with cheer 
i hope that i can be with you 
on christmas every year 
our second first kiss 
we dwell on the past  while living the present 
but i admit  the past was unpleasant 
full of ups and downs  less pleasure more pain 
we wished for the sun  but only got rain 
we both made mistakes  put pain in our hearts 
but here we are again  promising to never part 
counting our blessings and letting go of the past 
starting all over and making it last 
feelings and memories flow deep in my mind 
of those days our love was genuine and kind 
holding you close  feeling your skin 
you look into my eyes and make my head spin 
those feelings are back  but stronger than ever 
i know you 're the one i wan na hold on to forever 
we both smile again  nothing 's better than this 
kissing you again was like our second first kiss  
imagine 
imagine the woods 
without a tree 
imagine the rivers 
without the sea 
imagine yourself 
without me 
imagine how lost 
i would be  
our story 
my grizzled eyes stalked your lissome limbs 
and discovered camouflaged curves  
i purred a secret smile  
i 'm not reckless and thought to retire  
but then your winsome smile  
my surprised spirit soared on seldom seen condor wings  
my excitement ripened like a restrained volcano  
you snared my mind with comfortable associations  
we progressed  each touch thrilled arousal  
now  you welcome my eyes  my lips  and my feckless fingers  
my touch is no trespass  
you 've let me pass the sentries around your soul  
and we soar  
the reason is you 
you 're the reason for these butterflies 
that are fluttering uncontrollable inside of me 
these butterflies will never calm 
they 've taken over my whole body 
you 're the reason for this smile 
that brightens my whole face 
this smile will never frown 
you 've unknowingly became my all 
you make me feel alive once again 
you 've erased my past with just a touch 
chased my fears with just one glance 
you broke my mold with that first kiss 
i thought my happiness was forbidden 
until you took my world and killed my demons 
read into all my deepest dreams 
and gave them beautiful wings 
you 're the reason i believe in love 
my love .. everlasting 
you were a dream 
a dream that filled my thoughts 
and my loneliest nights  
you were the dream i held on to 
the dream my heart longed to one day have  
you were the dream that made me smile 
an escape from my reality 
a fantasy i longed to one day come true  
once only my dream  my escape  my fantasy 
came true the day when i first saw you  
my dream that used to be 
is now my reality  
a fantasy waiting for its happy ending 
is now a fairytale come true  
once my only escape 
is now the comfort that i live for  
together we have been through the heartaches 
the pain of walking away or being left behind  
every new road we had to take 
because of the choices we had to make 
only paved the road 
that brought us closer to one another  
life may not be easy 
with all the burdens and drama 
that life hands to us 
but when you find someone 
to share your life with 
no drama is hard to handle 
no burden is hard to bare  
when you have someone 
the one that you 've dreamed of 
then your life becomes the escape you both take 
to get away from the reality that surrounds  
i know because 
i found the love 
my lifetime partner 
my soul mate 
in you  
a candle within me 
a small flame burning 
fueled by your eyes  your laughter  your astonishing smile  
a yearning within me 
an aching longing 
deepened by your joy  your charm  your ephemeral grace  
a love within me 
a passion everlasting 
you dance among the stars  and in my fevered heart  
my 
you are my strength 
my sunshine 
my treasure 
my world 
my crush 
my everything 
my heart 's desire 
you are my greatest love  
beloved 
you are forever loved 
though this life fades away 
and all mortal bodies decay  
you will forever be my beloved 
my imortal betrothed 
my enduring flame 
my guiding light 
my compass rose  
you taught me 
i wanted a mansion once .. that is until i met you 
now the only place i want to live is inside your heart 
i once desired diamonds .. until i met you 
now the only sparkle i need comes from within 
i used to crave the finest clothing .. until i met you 
now i want not a single thread to separate our bodies 
i once coveted a fancy car .. until i met you 
now i want nothing that would put miles between us 
i once prayed for money .. until i met you 
now i want none of the things money can buy 
i once yearned for a sense of security .. until i met you 
now my only security comes is knowing you are near 
i once dreamt of a prestigious job .. until i met you 
now i find my success in knowing that you are happy 
i once asked for the world on a silver platter .. until i met you 
now you are my world and i want for nothing but your touch 
loving you has been my teacher  you taught me not to want 
being with you has been my discovery  you are all that i need 
finding you has been my salvation  i now understand grateful 
but perhaps of most importantly 
your love in return has been my everything 
autumn sonnet ( for dennis ) 
now autumn 's here  winter 's not far away  
already you 've attained three score and ten  
we notice now the shortening of the day 
our spring and summer gone  wo n't come again  
although our love is young  we 're growing old 
so savour mellow fruitfulness a while  
let 's glory in the autumn and be bold 
we 'll laugh and greet each new day with a smile  
give me your hand my love and let us be 
close friends  fond lovers  help-mates to the end 
and best of all to be good company 
sharing whatever else this life may send  
come kiss me love and hold me in your arms 
before cold winter freezes all my charms  
superhero 
my love for you reaches past the furthest planet 
burns stronger then the sun 
will last longer then eternity  
for you i 'd travel to the moon and back 
climb the tallest tower 
fight the largest army  
you are my friend 
my companion 
my lover 
my soulmate  
you are my reason to live 
my elixir of life 
without you i 'm nothing 
with you i 'm a superhero  
two butterflies 
watch with me 
the butterflies dancing by 
until the journey 's end  
not knowing where their travels lead 
in light and love  my friend  
flecks of light 
across the azure sky 
gently they descend  
settle weary wings on your open hand 
in faith and trust  my friend  
carry our wishes 
beyond the stars 
as we watch our life transcend  
we journey down the starlit path 
in life and love  my friend  
the way i feel 
the way i feel 
when i 'm with you 
i forget my troubles 
like there 's just us two  
you make my heart 
beat fast and strong 
and you make me feel 
that i truly belong  
you fill the gaps 
inside my heart 
like i 've finally found 
my missing part  
i sink in your eyes 
i 'm warmed by your smile 
and the world is perfect 
just for a while  
you make life better 
than it used to be  
you are the sugar 
in my cup of tea  
whenever you need me 
i 'll always be there  
i 'll be there to talk to 
i 'll be there to care  
because for you 
i would do anything  
deep into the green of the forest 
i once took to safari 
to discover the secrets of the wild  
among the thickets and the bushes 
i saw a flower in blossom 
shining like in its first day of bloom  
that was one time my eyes fell on you 
among the population in my home town 
like the flower that i saw 
it was you shining among them 
you comforted my heart 
making me come up to you  
that was then the day 
like a dove that had lost its partner 
i cooed  you to woo  
how you made me discover my lyrics again 
to you i sang and danced 
song after song i spoke my heart to you  
little did i know wild flower 
you would return love in abundance 
like the sands of the sea 
day after day i shovel for love 
ever abundant  never ending 
the reason my heart follows you  
tempted and pleased with your ways 
in the wild i would never let you be  
with care and utmost wanting i dug you up 
planting you in the garden of my heart 
there you flourish 
there you bloom and shine  
when i gaze in rapturous admiration 
at your perfection and beauty 
and stare in wonder and longing 
at your swaying  feline grace 
oh  how it is better to remain silent 
than attempt in total futility 
to describe the awe i feel 
about matters that speech is incompetent to express 
or strive to convey in vain my wondrous elation 
as i immerse myself in your cerulean eyes 
and with utmost joy  tell you 
just how much i love you  
in my arms  in my heart 
i was lonely and somewhat lost 
i wanted a companion and friend  nothing more 
i took the plunge  in i stepped 
nervous and unsure  i waded in 
unexperienced and quite unsure 
feeling trepidation  i wondered if i did right 
feeling shy but needing a ladies company 
i took a chance  to see what would occur 
surprise  shock and so much joy 
i found the woman of my dreams  i won first prize 
gentle  caring  trusting and sensuous  along you came 
into my life  you brought happiness  fulfilment 
and everything i had secretly yearned for 
not sure how i would cope and react 
from that first meeting i was complete 
such emotions flowed through me 
that i believed i would never feel 
beauty  tenderness  faith  desire and love came fast 
all my hidden dreams were answered 
by your marvellous presence 
from that first meeting  who would believe 
such a strong romance would start 
when we are together all i need 
is in my arms  in my heart 
come with me 
mystery  it clouds your form 
ecstasy  it keeps us warm 
the dance has begun  with but us two 
i 'll take your hand  i 'll walk with you 
take me to depths in the sea of love 
go with me further  never enough 
i 'll breathe in your perfumed scent 
you intoxicate  invade my head 
give in to your senses  here we go 
follow me now  let your heart take control 
our time is short  and death is nigh 
to mountains and peaks  we must fly 
leave life behind in our own world 
get away from it all  run with me  my pearl 
forget all your troubles  walk in the moonlight 
gaze into my eyes  stay with me tonight 
we need not fear  we must venture on 
forsake loneliness  drink in our love 's song 
pure angel of dawn  you 've stolen my heart 
you illuminate me  pierce the dark 
your purity  it leaves me numb 
your beauty  where does it come from  
i long to touch your smooth  soft skin 
to stroke your hair  give you everything 
to pull you into my embrace 
to hear you breathe  to see your face 
to feel your heart beat softly with mine 
to hold you tightly  leave reason behind 
to draw you in  to taste your kiss 
all heartbreak gone  nothing amiss 
i 'd lose myself inside your eyes 
stay in love forever  mesmerized 
run away with me  barefoot in the sand 
walk by my side  rule all the lands 
hear our hearts beating with love so wild 
our heads spinning with passion  my child 
there 's untamed joy we ca n't contain 
hypnotizing ardor we ca n't explain 
i 'm romeo  will you be juliet  
we can share a bond we 'll never forget 
we can clasp hands in the twilight 
hold each other  day and night 
we can be alone  just me and you 
our souls entwined  you know it 's true 
we can do anything  if you 'll take faith 
i 'll protect you  i 'll keep you safe 
we can be together eternally 
we can live forever – so come with me 
when nights are long & friends are few 
i sit by my window & think of you 
a silent whisper  a silent tear 
i love you with all my heart 
i wish you were here 
when i look back 
when i look back 
on the dreams i left behind  
buried there in all my thoughts 
it is you i always find  
i saw you then as i see you now 
through love 's impassioned blindness 
a heart so fashioned there within 
filled with love and kindness  
how often has my heart declared 
with anguish  for my words are few 
that the wind shall blow a little longer 
to keep me here with you  
sweeter still are the pains of love  
the bonds of love grow stronger 
even after the moonlight has gone to sleep 
i shall always love you longer  
no other can stir my heart so deep 
or thrill me through and through 
and in my dreams there will never be 
no other love but you  
when i look back to times gone by 
there is one sure thing i know 
it is you my love  who stole my heart 
fifty years ago  
ode to a beautiful girl 
your magnificent eyes  dark emeralds aflame 
your silky bronzed hair  still perfect in rain 
the way you walk  a light antelope in prance 
so cheerful and happy  ever ready to dance 
your lithe brazilian figure  i marvel through the days 
how beautiful you do become  in the wondrous sunshine rays 
on those rare moments  when your eyes meet mine 
i feel a warm pleasure and a chill down my spine 
when i hear your sweet laughter  a melodious tune 
i feel alive  full of joy  i could fly to the moon 
i sit idly nigh always wishing you 'd see 
perhaps even come and sit down next to me 
i watch how you smile  and send jolts through my heart 
your sensual features a fine work of art 
sometimes i watch the evening 's amber sun 
and i calm myself down  from thoughts weighing a tonne 
the soothing orange invigorates my mind 
as do you  always so kind 
amoroso 
we have climbed the tall blue mountain 
to touch the eagle 's wing 
trekked the valley far below them 
to drink from crystal springs 
we have walked among the tall grasses 
through wildflowers we were lead 
they stood like noble kings and queens 
with crowns upon their heads 
the goldfinch and her family 
they kiss like you and i 
in the morning and come the evening 
they sing sweet lullabies 
i look back across the seasons 
thankful you were there 
to have wrapped my arms around you 
put ribbons in your hair 
if tomorrow holds my promise 
it will be to forever gaze into your eyes 
and dance with you forever 
in a land with no good-byes  
loved you yesterday  love you still 
always have  always will  
to the one i love 
beautiful lady  lily of the field 
you  my umbrella and my shield 
your adoration showers like the rains 
and drowns all odds and pains  
searching everywhere unto the crest 
clear you stood above the rest 
for never in my dreams most sweet 
did i such a lovely damsel meet  
mesmerised i am  dreaming all the while 
of when we shall walk down the aisle 
to vows we take we shall keep 
with our affection ever deep  
for eternity our love shall sprout 
though the world be in drought 
a union most blissful  this i know 
for we ever shall sparkle and glow  
you are the sea that lulls me to sleep  
you are the treasure every pirate wants to keep  
you are the sun that gives life to my day  
you are the moon that lights the dark way  
you are the kiss that sets me free  
you are the embrace that comforts me  
you are the yin and yang of my life  
so i ask you now  please be my wife  
beautiful lady 
a beautiful lady with eyes on fire 
that sparkle and laugh  that can smile and cry 
i love your eyes so clear and true  
beautiful lady i adore you  
a twinkling look that bubbles bright 
with a heart to care  and a heart to love 
with hands to hold  and hands to help 
beautiful lady there to give  
beautiful lady  a smile so bright 
so warm and gentle  so soft a delight  
a voice so clear 
that calms and soothes  a voice that wipes all fears  
beautiful lady 
i 'll give to you  my thoughts  my prayers  my hopes 
i offer you my heart  my strength  
my love is yours for ever  
beautiful lady 
i love you as you are  
beautiful  
thoughts 
i thought that i 'd seen beauty 
i thought i 'd witnessed grace 
i thought that i 'd known love 
'til i gazed upon your face  
i thought i 'd felt my heart beat 
i thought my knees were weak 
i thought i 'd heard a songbird 
until i heard you speak  
i thought the rose was fragrant 
i thought the sky was blue 
i thought nature wonderful 
'til i first laid eyes on you  
i thought the sun was shining 
i thought i 'd seen it all 
i thought that i was standing 
until you made me fall  
i thought my eyes were open 
yet now i 'm not so sure 
i think that i may be in love 
like i 've never loved before  
i 'll hold on to these feelings 
and keep them safe within 
until the time they 're needed 
and true love can begin 
a new season 
soft  wet  warm  like summer rain 
cooling my core 
settling the ache 
waiting abated 
we fall  in love 
and winter never comes  
if i can hold you in my arms 
then i can touch you with my heart 
for my husband 
loving you has no end and no beginning 
loving you is everything 
it is infinite in time 
and limitless in magnitude 
beyond even my own comprehension 
your love brings me home 
enfolds me and warms me 
in its eternal embrace 
endless and palpable 
beyond all life 's storms 
a connection like no other 
twenty years long 
but timeless in our hearts 
deep and true 
til  death us do part 
like the warmth of the morning sun 
so do thoughts of you embrace me 
revealing how alive i am 
a glorious light of the new day 
so is your presence in my life 
relieving it of its shadows 
and marking the start of a new beginning 
if only you knew 
in the darkness of the night  there is only me and you 
we are woven together in our very own cocoon  
i feel your heartbeat against my chest 
i hold you tight as we both rest  
i start to drift off to sleep 
and think of how i turned complete  
i am only complete when you are near 
to lose you someday is my biggest fear  
it takes two halves to make a whole 
my heart and yours we make one soul  
full circle 
we are here my love together again 
back where we should have always been 
back where we were meant to be 
together as one just you and me 
while we were apart it seemed so wrong 
i longed for you my whole life long 
i ached to be with you so very much 
to hear your voice to feel your touch 
and now at last we 've met once more 
in love again as we were before 
more in love than we could have ever supposed 
together again life 's circle closed  
your husband 
when times are hard  when news is bad 
when life seems a universe from brightness and joy 
when this happens  my love  i need you to know 
there is a person close who feels every tear 
a person close who holds you dear  
when you cry  he cries too  not always to see 
but always and with the full depth of his beating heart  
when you do not cry but the pain shows in your eyes 
he will know and share this too 
his passion hidden under a stoic umbrella 
a shield of calm prevents emotion displayed  
he knows of your journey through the turbulence of life 
he respects and admires the tireless fight 
he hates a world that could cause you pain 
such innocence undeserving  he longs for your return to the sun 
a summer 's mind where fears dissipate like seeds in wind 
to see what he loves  your smile to infinity 
your passion for life .. with vigour  with humour  with cheer  
so look over your shoulder and he 'll be there 
no matter the distance  the time  he 'll be there 
watching you in sleep  aloof in morning haze 
as distance grows through day  the care for you remains  
he is your husband  your friend  your protector  your knight 
he is me my darling  he is me  
kiss me my love 
and know that it 's true 
my love is forever 
and only for you 
it ca n't be denied 
for it dwells in my soul 
with you i 'm alive 
you make me whole 
kiss me my love 
and join me in bliss 
my love is forever 
and so is my kiss 
your gaze my great joy 
to you i belong 
our love is the lyric 
you are my song 
kiss me my love 
and give me that smile 
my love is forever 
a promise that i 'll 
dream only of you 
awaking to find 
the dream 's before me 
the joy of my mind 
kiss me my love 
again and again 
my love is forever 
a deep seated yen 
awash in your love 
with you as my wife 
so thankful for you 
the best gift of my life
