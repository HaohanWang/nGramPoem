                  A Special World

                  A special world for you and me
                  A special bond one cannot see
                  It wraps us up in its cocoon
                  And holds us fiercely in its womb.
 
                  Its fingers spread like fine spun gold
                  Gently nestling us to the fold
                  Like silken thread it holds us fast
                  Bonds like this are meant to last.
 
                  And though at times a thread may break
                  A new one forms in its wake
                  To bind us closer and keep us strong
                  In a special world, where we belong.

                  An Entrapment
 
                  My love, I have tried with all my being
                  to grasp a form comparable to thine own,
                  but nothing seems worthy;
                  I know now why Shakespeare could not
                  compare his love to a summer’s day. 
                  It would be a crime to denounce the beauty
                  of such a creature as thee,
                  to simply cast away the precision
                  God had placed in forging you.
                  Each facet of your being
                  whether it physical or spiritual
                  is an ensnarement
                  from which there is no release.
                  But I do not wish release.
                  I wish to stay entrapped forever.
                  With you for all eternity.
                  Our hearts, always as one.

                  If I could have just one wish,
                  I would wish to wake up everyday
                  to the sound of your breath on my neck,
                  the warmth of your lips on my cheek,
                  the touch of your fingers on my skin,
                  and the feel of your heart beating with mine...
                  Knowing that I could never find that feeling
                  with anyone other than you.

                  What I Love About You

                  I love the way you look at me,
                  Your eyes so bright and blue.
                  I love the way you kiss me,
                  Your lips so soft and smooth.

                  I love the way you make me so happy,
                  And the ways you show you care.
                  I love the way you say, "I Love You,"
                  And the way you're always there.

                  I love the way you touch me,
                  Always sending chills down my spine.
                  I love that you are with me,
                  And glad that you are mine.

                  A gentle word like a spark of light,
                  Illuminates my soul
                  And as each sound goes deeper,
                  It's YOU that makes me whole

                  There is no corner, no dark place,
                  YOUR LOVE cannot fill
                  And if the world starts causing waves,
                  It's your devotion that makes them still

                  And yes you always speak to me,
                  In sweet honesty and truth
                  Your caring heart keeps out the rain,
                  YOUR LOVE, the ultimate roof

                  So thank you my Love for being there,
                  For supporting me, my life
                  I'll do the same for you, you know,
                  My Beautiful, Darling Wife.

                  A stranger you were once.
                  Then, with a gentle look you took my hand.
                  As our lives engaged,
                  you lit my life and I held both your hands.
                  Now that decades have passed,
                  ours souls have indeed become one.
                  How fortunate we are 
                  that we have found the love so true
                  that everyone dreams about.

                  You're my man, my mighty king,
                  And I'm the jewel in your crown,
                  You're the sun so hot and bright,
                  I'm your light-rays shining down,

                  You're the sky so vast and blue,
                  And I'm the white clouds in your chest,
                  I'm a river clean and pure,
                  Who in your ocean finds her rest,

                  You're the mountain huge and high,
                  I'm the valley green and wide,
                  You're the body firm and strong,
                  And I'm a rib bone on your side,

                  You're an eagle flying high,
                  I'm your feathers light and brown,
                  You're my man, my king of kings,
                  And I'm the jewel in your crown.

                  Never Have I Fallen

                  Your lips speak soft sweetness
                  Your touch a cool caress
                  I am lost in your magic
                  My heart beats within your chest

                  I think of you each morning
                  And dream of you each night
                  I think of your arms being around me
                  And cannot express my delight
 
                  Never have I fallen
                  But I am quickly on my way
                  You hold a heart in your hands
                  That has never before been given away

                  Your Name

                  I wrote your name in the sky,
                  but the wind blew it away.
                  I wrote your name in the sand,
                  but the waves washed it away.
                  I wrote your name in my heart,
                  and forever it will stay.

                  Love is the greatest feeling,
                  Love is like a play,

                  Like a love I can't control,
                  So remember when your eyes meet mine,
                  I love you with all my heart,
                  And I have poured my entire soul into you,
                  Right from the very start.

                  I love you so deeply,

                  All the love that history knows,
                  is said to be in every rose.
                  Yet all that could be found in two,
                  is less than what I feel for you.

                  A White Rose

                  The red rose whispers of passion,
                  And the white rose breathes of love;
                  O, the red rose is a falcon,
                  And the white rose is a dove.
                  But I send you a cream-white rosebud
                  With a flush on its petal tips;
                  For the love that is purest and sweetest
                  Has a kiss of desire on the lips.

                  My Love

                  My love is like an ocean
                  It goes down so deep
                  My love is like a rose
                  Whose beauty you want to keep.
 
                  My love is like a river
                  That will never end
                  My love is like a dove
                  With a beautiful message to send.
 
                  My love is like a song
                  That goes on and on forever
                  My love is like a prisoner
                  It's to you that I surrender.

                  Love

                  Love is like a lump of gold,
                  Hard to get, and hard to hold.
                  Of all the girls I've ever met,
                  You're the one I can't forget.
                  I do believe that God above,
                  Created you for me to love.
                  He chose you from all the rest,
                  Because he knew I would love you best.

                  I thought love was just a mirage of the mind,
                  it's an illusion, it's fake, impossible to find.
                  But the day I met you, I began to see,
                  that love is real, and exists in me.

                  Perfection in my Eyes

                  All I ever wanted was to be part of your heart,
                  And for us to be together, to never be apart.

                  No one else in the world can even compare,
                  You're perfect and so is this love that we share.

                  We have so much more than I ever thought we would,
                  I love you more than I ever thought I could.

                  I promise to give you all I have to give,
                  I'll do anything for you as long as I live.

                  In your eyes I see our present, our future and past,
                  By the way you look at me I know we will last.

                  I hope that one day you'll come to realize,
                  How perfect you are when seen through my eyes.

                  Day by day
                  Night by night
                  Kiss by kiss
                  Touch by touch
                  Step by step
                  I fall in love
                  A love so incomprehensible
                  So vivid
                  So unique
                  So wild, that not even the reign of God could control
                  A passion so deep
                  A need so necessary
                  A want so strong
                  The universe would not handle
                  I love you today
                  I’ll love you tomorrow
                  I’ll love you forever

                  For The First Time

                  Into my world
                  of darkness and silence,
                  you brought light and music.

                  When you lit my candle,
                  I began to see and understand
                  the taste and texture of love.

                  For the first time.

                  I asked God for a flower, he gave me a bouquet
                  I asked God for a minute, he gave me a day
                  I asked God for true love, he gave me that too
                  I asked for an angel and he gave me you.

                  I dream of your touch while you are away,
                  I dream of your smile all through the day,
                  I remember the day,
                  You came into my life,
                  I dream of the day I will be your wife.

                  I dream of the day I can fall asleep next to you,
                  I dream of the day I can say I do.
                  To be your wife,
                  To be together for life,
                  Is a dream I have,
                  Every night.

                  My Sweetheart

                  So often when I am embracing you,
                  It seems that you exist in this world
                  only because of me and I exist because of you.

                  It's not easy to wander in this world
                  and not lose one's way,
                  but the greatest happiness of all
                  is in giving joy to one's beloved.

                  And if the king can have his throne,
                  and if the bird can have his Spring nest,
                  and God can have his heaven,
                  then I, my sweetheart, I can have you!

                  As Long As You're Near

                  The first time we met, I could see,
                  That you and I, were meant to be.
                  Your eyes were so gentle, your smile so true,
                  When you first held my hand, I just knew.
 
                  Now the time has gone by, through laughter and tears,
                  These days I shall cherish, for years upon years.
                  Those memories we have, shall never fade,
                  For those are the steps, that we have made.
 
                  That was the past, the future is near,
                  I anxiously wait, for what will appear.
                  New homes, more laughter, and children so dear,
                  Everything will be wonderful, as long as you're near.

                  Motionless

                  If time could stand still, I’d freeze it here,
                  So you’d always hold me, close and near.
                  In your arms, where I’m meant to be,
                  Filled with the perfect love you’ve given me.
 
                  A bond so strong, a hold so tight,
                  To know you’re the one; my ‘Mr. Right’.
                  A blessing sent from up above,
                  In you I’ve found my one true love.
 
                  Our lives entwined to be as one,
                  Upon this journey we’ve just begun.
                  Where you and I will find no less,
                  Than eternal love and happiness.

                  About You

                  Your touch is with me always,
                  It’s burnt into my skin,
                  As soft and warm as sun rays
                  When a summer day sets in.

                  Your soft voice never silent,
                  It’s forever in my ears,
                  Serenading every moment
                  And calming all my fears.

                  Your arms always enfold me,
                  The strength of angels wings,
                  They support and protect me wholly
                  With the safety a true love brings.

                  While I can never repay you,
                  For the wonder you bring to my life,
                  I can forever be true,
                  And forever be a true wife.

                  For Paul

                  I love the way you touch me
                  so soft and sensuously.
                  It makes me tingle all over.

                  I love the way you kiss me.
                  It starts a fire deep down inside of me
                  and makes me yearn for you even more.
 
                  I love the way you look at me.
                  It makes me feel beautiful and treasured.
                  Most of all I love the way you love me.

                  When you walk in my whole day gets better.
                  And even when you're not with me
                  you're in my thoughts always.

                  It doesn't matter what we don't have or what we do have.
                  The most important thing is we have each other
                  and no one can take that away.

                  I am the luckiest woman in the world
                  and I don't need or want anything
                  but you beside me loving me to the end of our days.

                  You Are My Forever Love

                  Your friendship and love,
                  And all the wonderful things
                  That they bring into my life,
                  Are like nothing else
                  I have ever known.

                  My heart is complete
                  With the love we share,
                  And our love grows more
                  Beautiful each day.

                  I love you,
                  And as long as we are together,
                  I have everything I need.

                  You are with me always...
                  In a smile, a memory, a feeling
                  Or a moment we share.

                  You will always be 
                  My Forever Love

                  You Are Poetry

                  You come outside
                  To view the faint sunset
                  Light bewildered by trees
                  Shines through quietly
                  You glide your soft auburn hair
                  Perched behind your ear
                  And in this moment I feel at home
                  Beneath the interior
                  You are my humble abode...
                  Your company is soothing
                  Calming and reassuring
                  Inside, the wind chimes ring
                  You saunter and my hearts sings
                  Bit by bit I begin to recognize
                  The enchanting glow in your subtle eyes
                  Hidden in all abstract paintings
                  It’s you; what all artists see
                  You are poetry...

                  I Love You
                   
                  I love you with a permanence
                  That endures the passing years.
                  I love you with a joyfulness
                  That subdues all doubts and fears.
                  I love you with an honesty
                  That was born within my heart.
                  I love you with the calm belief
                  That we will never part.
                  I love you with a confidence
                  No earthly force can sever.
                  I love you with the certainty
                  That I’ll cherish you forever.
                  I love you with the humbleness
                  Of one who has been blessed.
                  I love you with the reverence
                  Of all that word suggests.
                  I love you with a fervor
                  That time cannot reverse.
                  I love you with the truest love
                  That poets put to verse.

                  Soul Like The Vastest Sea

                  Your soul is like the vastest sea
                  And mine a darting fish:
                  I lose myself within your love;
                  I live within your heart.

                  I breathe your love: it is my air,
                  My element, my world.
                  I know no other ambiance;
                  I have no other dream.

                  I know there is outside your love
                  A world of rocks and sand;
                  And I could live there, too, but oh!
                  How poor and thin each breath!

                  How rich my world, how beautiful,
                  Alive within your love,
                  Each moment filled with dancing light
                  Refracted through your eyes!

                  - Awodiya Oluwadamilare -

                


                  I love you like I love a day
                  when everything goes right
                  I love you like I love to lay
                  and watch the stars at night
                  I love you like I love the rain
                  its lustful calm embrace
                  I love you like I love to laugh
                  until it hurts my face
                  I love you like I love to drive
                  with no real destination
                  I love you like I love the thrill
                  of pure infatuation
                  But most of all I love you like
                  I love a cherished friend
                  Who holds me tight, dries my tears
                  and loves me to the end

                  Sunshine

                  When I wake up in the morning
                  Sunshine's falling on my skin
                  And I call you up to tell you
                  What a happy mood I'm in

                  Feel the rhythm in my body
                  And sing is all I wanna do
                  I feel the day will bring me sunshine
                  for it's another day with you

                  - Nikki Daniëls -

                


                  If There's...

                  If there's one face I want to see,
                  so beautiful, so true,
                  one smile that makes a difference,
                  to everything I do.

                  If there's one touch I long to feel,
                  one voice I long to hear,
                  whenever I am happy,
                  or just needing someone near.

                  If there's one joy, one love,
                  from which I never want to part,
                  it's you, my very special love,
                  my world, my life, my heart.

                  Dance Me To The End Of Love

                  Dance with me in love
                  Dance with me in life
                  When did enduring love begin?
                  The day we became man and wife

                  There is patience and understanding
                  We try to be unselfish and kind
                  Though not a fairy-tale romance
                  No greater love will we find

                  Sharing dreams, passions, and desires
                  Building each other up when we fall
                  We've learned to say I'm sorry
                  And I love you through it all

                  Our two hearts beat as one
                  Cherishing what we have from above
                  Dance with me forever
                  Dance me to the end of love

                  Red Rose

                  Our love is that of a red rose
                  Whose splendor rises as the sun shows its face,
                  Whose petals expand further and richer
                  Whispering secrets of happiness and affection.

                  And even though with the fall of dusk
                  All contentment is swept away,
                  And the rose's petals unite as one
                  Reflecting any light that may endeavor to shine through,
                  The sun will always rise
                  And the rose's petals will eternally broaden
                  Until they fully blossom into a stunning creation.

                  Our love is that of a red rose
                  Possessing a few imperfections
                  That may cause evanescent wounds,
                  But the internal radiance
                  That will everlastingly bestow healing and comfort.

                  The Golden Path

                  Take my hand this way we'll go,
                  Said the man above,
                  I'll take you to a place of joy,
                  Where you will find true love,

                  If you let go, go on your own,
                  But mistakes you will make,
                  For many other ways there are,
                  Which you are sure to take,

                  When you feel that you are lost,
                  All you have to do is pray,
                  And I'll be there once again,
                  To help you on your way,

                  I did pray and just as said,
                  He shined his light from above,
                  That showed me the way down the golden path,
                  That led me to your love.

                  To lay a kiss on your lips,
                  so gentle and delicate
                  is like picking the drops of dew
                  off the petals of a rose.

                  I hold you close and feel safe,
                  sheltered in from the rain,
                  from the storms that grow and surround me.
                  I take your hand and look into your eyes
                  and see a heart made of gold and soul so pure.

                  You see you are an angel, an angel to me.
                  I could not help but fall madly in love with you,
                  the one who stole my heart.

                  I’m glad you did
                  because I could never find one such as you...
                  Some one who makes each day the best,
                  each laugh the longest,
                  each tear the saddest,
                  and a life, my life, worthwhile.

                  Poem For Sharon

                  Why is it that some people who find love,
                  handle it with such carelessness?

                  Some people search for love all their lives.
                  When it is found, why put it down and forget about it,
                  only to realize how much it meant when it is gone?

                  When you find love, hold on to it,
                  celebrate its feelings,
                  drown in them every day,
                  be consumed by them...

                  I am consumed by you Sharon.

                  I will never set aside my love.
                  I will never look for it only when it is lost.

                  I love you.
                  I will show you and tell you every day.

                  - Chris Todd -

                


                  "Yes!"

                  My joy is overflowing,
                  you got down on your knee
                  and have professed forever
                  your special love for me.
                  There was no hesitation,
                  the moment I said "yes,"
                  and gave life to the feelings
                  I'm longing to express.
                  I give myself completely,
                  my heart belongs to you;
                  I'm counting every moment
                  until we say "I do."
                  You are the perfect person
                  to compliment my life;
                  there'll be no brighter day than
                  when I become your wife.

                  You came into my life unexpectedly,
                  and everything took a turn for the better.
                  Your warm eyes, your laugh,
                  the sincere way you speak,
                  and the kindness you showed me,
                  all became a part of my life.

                  As you unfolded yourself to me,
                  I discovered more and more beauty.
                  I have never seen so much
                  gentleness in one person.
                  Without even knowing it,
                  you were slowly making a place
                  for yourself in my heart.

                  It used to seem so hard at times
                  to feel so close in a relationship.
                  But it’s so easy to feel close to you.
                  I can’t tell you how nice that feels.
                  I realize now that I had never known
                  what it meant to be loved
                  until I was loved by you.

                  A Love Like No Other

                  I never felt a love
                  Like this before
                  It's a love like no other
                  Something I have always hoped for

                  A love with friendship 
                  Humour and heart
                  A bond so strong
                  It would never part

                  A love that makes you smile
                  From ear to ear
                  A love that is joyful
                  Without any fear

                  A love that is beautiful
                  From the inside out
                  A love with no tears,
                  Pain, or doubt

                  A love with soul
                  So tender and true
                  A love that I have found
                  Only in you...

                  As I look outside I see the breeze
                  Caress the leaves from the trees
                  And carry them to all around
                  Gently laid upon the ground
                  I see the birds so high above
                  Their songs sing of our special love
                  And laid upon their soft sweet wing
                  Your love to me they gently bring
                  And as they start their graceful descent
                  Delivering a message that’s heaven sent
                  One thing I know and will hold so dear
                  When I see them fly I will feel you near

                  Deep As The Rose Is Red

                  I'll give you my heart; I'll open it up,
                  Will you listen to its small still voice?
                  For soft and quiet my heart will speak
                  To the one I'll call my wife.

                  Did you hear it dear? Did you listen well?
                  Do you understand what it said?
                  For deep is the love that it speaks to you,
                  Deep as the rose is red.

                  So, take my heart and treat it well
                  And forever in this life,
                  Come walk with me, your hand in mine,
                  The one I'll call my wife.

                  - Melvin D. Sharrar -

                


                  Onto the sea
                  I sailed my boat
                  And prayed that it
                  Would stay afloat

                  From dawn til dusk
                  From dusk til dawn
                  In search of love
                  I drifted on

                  What happened then
                  I don't recall
                  I think it was
                  A sudden squall

                  For when I awoke
                  I thought I died
                  At the sight of an angel
                  At my side

                  But lucky for me
                  That was not true
                  For I found love
                  And love was you.
 
                  - Britney Brundage -

                


                  Feelings

                  As I wake by your side,
                  My feelings for you I can not hide,
                  I touch your face in the morning light,
                  Being with you just feels so right

                  You make me feel like I'm a queen,
                  Like being inside an awesome dream,
                  Although this is real, that I know,
                  As the love that surrounds us continues to grow

                  I think of what the future holds...
                  Marriage, children, us growing old,
                  And as I lay, with you dear,
                  I'm just so glad you're mine, you're here.

                  - Jo Pye -

                


                  My eyes beheld a sky one night,
                  It seems so long ago,
                  A perfectly painted portrait,
                  Be-speckled with blue and gold.

                  As I sit and ponder more,
                  It strikes me that you were there,
                  And it was truly your simple beauty,
                  That gave the stars their perfect glare.

                  Beauty
                  
                  Your lips, your eyes, your soul
                  Are like a work of art,
                  The most creative thing of all
                  Is your beautiful heart.

                  If you were a painting,
                  No colours could express
                  The beauty deep inside you,
                  A rainbow, nothing less.

                  If you were a sculpture
                  The clay could hardly make
                  Your figure of an angel
                  Without one mistake.

                  If you were a euphony
                  No choir could really sing
                  All the beautiful music
                  Your eyes could possibly bring.

                  So here I am, an artist,
                  With inspiration beyond belief
                  But to capture such rare beauty,
                  I'd have to be a thief.

                  A Patchwork Quilt
                   
                  Made up of memories of you
                  Bound together with love
                  Sewn with your selfless giving
                  Threads made of grace
                  Lined with thoughts of you.
 
                  Squares made of days gone by
                  Days we spent together
                  Each with a new design
                  Of the things that we shared.
 
                  Blanket stitches of our hearts
                  Mingle the squares in rows
                  Nothing can tear it apart
                  Not fire or flood or anything close.
 
                  It’s kept in a place of my keeping
                  The treasure chest of my heart
                  Wrapped in tissue of forgiveness
                  And tied with ribbons of love.
 
                  The colors all speak of you
                  Pinks and Blues and other hues
                  Sewn tight and fastened together
                  With hope and faith and truth.

                  From Now Until Forever
 
                  I’ve never known a love like yours
                  Nor thought it could be true,
                  But every time I kiss your lips
                  I feel what love can do

                  With hair like silk
                  And lips so tender,
                  Each moment with you
                  Makes my heart surrender

                  I couldn’t live, I couldn’t breathe
                  Without you by my side,
                  Never will I let you go,
                  My love will never hide

                  And in my heart you’ll always be
                  From now until forever,
                  No matter what, no matter where
                  We’ll always be together

                  One Year Of Happiness 

                  One year of holding hands
                  One year of hugging,
                  One year of laughing,
                  One year of cuddling.

                  One year of loving
                  One year of kissing
                  One year of touching
                  One year of romancing.

                  One year of your love
                  One year of my love,
                  One year of our love
                  One year of true love.

                  Baby one year with you
                  Is a year of happiness,
                  A year of passion,
                  A year of joy,
                  A year blessed.

                  The sun grows dim across the sky
                  and the world prepares for bed

                  I oft can take a moment now
                  to view the sky above
                  and whisper God a simple prayer
                  to thank him for your love

                  Is stuck in my mind
                  The taste of your lips
                  So sweet that I find
                  Myself lost in the thought
                  Of our next embrace
                  I see now I'm caught
                  Without even a chase

                  You make me feel special,
                  You make me feel new,
                  You make me feel loved,
                  With everything you do.
 
                  You hold me close when I am sad.
                  You wipe the tears from my face.
                  Every time we are together,
                  It seems like the perfect place.
 
                  My eyes light up when you enter a room.
                  I smile when we are together.
                  No matter how bad things are,
                  You always make them better.
 
                  I love the way you kiss me,
                  The way you hold me tight.
                  I love the way you touch me,
                  I could be with you all night.
 
                  I love the way you can make me laugh
                  For absolutely no reason at all.
                  I love how no matter what I do,
                  You will be there to catch me when I fall.
 
                  I just want you to know,
                  That even though we sometimes fight,
                  I will always love you!
                  No matter what, day or night.

                  Soft gentle stare
                  Warm tender touch
                  You took my hand
                  And we danced
 
                  Arms around me
                  Light dragging moves
                  Cheek warm against mine
                  Breathing deep from the soul
 
                  Long have I searched
                  Finally I have found
                  When you took my hand
                  And we danced

                  Creatively
                  You worked your art
                  You spun a web
                  Around my heart
                  How beautifully
                  Your deeds have spread
                  Each intricately
                  Woven thread
                  With strands of care

                  Helped me understand
                  And patiently
                  You held my hand
                  To give me courage
                  To brave the storm
                  With kindness
                  You have kept me warm
                  Your passion
                  Lit a glowing fire
                  That filled my soul
                  With sweet desire
                  You're all
                  That I was dreaming of
                  For the web you spun
                  Was made of love

                  Our Sonnet

                  Sweet Lady, song of my heart,
                  Hold my hand, as this journey we start.
                  Lift me up in spirit of joy and gladness;
                  And shield my soul from heartbreak and sadness.
                  Steadfast, honest and true;
                  Your partner is here and will forever love you.
  
                   
                  It is my prayer that I will always be;
                  The one who brings you joy and sets your spirit free.
                  With my love I’ll cover you and warm your soul with mine;
                  Give you pleasures – like none you will find.
                  Your Sweet Lady, song of your heart;
                  Will love you forever, together or apart.
                   

                  So hear me Sweet Lady, and know in your soul;
                  That there is no better future than with you to grow old.
                  Endless caresses, touches and kisses;
                  Our passion a banner for our love’s true existence.
                  My hand I extend and my honor I offer;
                  For being with you my love, there is no greater pleasure.

                   
                  Your hand I accept, and all your love as well;
                  My heart sings so loudly, all can tell
                  I am loved and in love with the man made for me
                  Hold my hand; let us walk through this life
                  Being what we were meant to be
                  Together.

                  One Special Night

                  As I sit here gazing out the window,
                  Instead of working, I’m daydreaming of you...
                  And wondering if while you’re in your own world,
                  You’re thinking of me too.
 
                  I reminisce about the day we met and how you made me feel,
                  Looking at the glowing smile on your face,
                  Staring into your dreamy blue eyes,
                  Your smell, your touch, your warm embrace
 
                  What a special night that was...
 
                  And now, I’m starting to feel that warmth inside,
                  Like nothing or no one else can make me feel...
                  Butterflies, a constant smile, happy thoughts,
                  Looking forward to the next time we meet.
 
                  What lies ahead, down the road to love?
                  Can it possibly be what I’ve been hoping for?
                  All my goals, dreams, passions, hopes...
                  Glaring now before me with great anticipation.
 
                  No one knows what tomorrow brings...
                  One can only wish and believe...
                  I have abounding faith that God will take care of me,
                  And bring the right person into my life.
 
                  Could it be you?
                  Time will tell...
                  I feel a special bond starting between us,
                  And so I’m truly hopeful that it is (you).

                  When I First Looked Into Your Eyes

                  When first I looked into your eyes
                  each breath became a thousand sighs.
                  My heart drummed out a thunder beat
                  I glowed with joy from head to feet.
                  The hand of love had touched my soul,
                  as the bell of destiny began to toll.
                  The tide of love began to rise,
                  the world was filled with summer skies.
                  My sodden clouds of cold and grey
                  glowed with gold, then wisped away.
                  A brilliant rainbow arched across,
                  as waves of love began to toss.
                  The air was filled with lovebird cries,
                  when I first looked into your eyes.
 
                  When I first looked into your eyes,
                  all time and space were paralyzed
                  And in that instant, I was shown
                  a universe I had never known.
                  I dwell there still, in Paradise,
                  when I look into your eyes.

                  Everytime I Look At The Stars

                  I gazed in your eyes,
                  Such a beautiful blue;
                  My heart whispered to me,
                  And that’s right when I knew;
                  The waves had ceased crashing,
                  On the sand at our feet;
                  Time had stopped passing,
                  My search was complete;
                  I finally discovered,
                  What I'd known all along;
                  A mystery uncovered,
                  That just couldn't be wrong;
                  It wasn't our first kiss,
                  Nor' the day that we met;
                  But I realized something,
                  I will never forget;
                  With the stars shining brightly,
                  From high up above;
                  I'd one word to describe it,
                  That word, is love.
                  I knew then these feelings,
                  For my sweetheart were true;
                  The man of my dreams,
                  And my soulmate, is you.
                  I think of it every time,
                  That I look at the stars;
                  This memory is mine,
                  But that moment was
                  OURS.

                  Dreaming

                  I used to dream of eyes so blue
                  And loving arms to hold me.
                  I used to dream of heroic knights
                  And how gracious they would be.

                  I used to dream of how I wouldn’t settle
                  For anything less than best.
                  I used to dream of how he would majestically
                  Lay all fears to rest.

                  I used to dream of fairy tales,
                  How wondrous would they be
                  I used to dream of story books
                  All patterned after me.

                  I used to dream of a lot of things,
                  But the moment I met you,
                  I immediately stopped dreaming,
                  Because all of my dreams came true.

                  The grey began to fade,
                  As the colours filled the sky,
                  The chill began to warm,
                  As the sun began to rise.
 
                  A lost girl found direction,
                  As the eastern orb rose high,
                  The dark sky turned to blue,
                  Like the colour of his eyes.
 
                  Dark turned to light,
                  Grey turned to blue,

                  That's when I met you.

                  Every time I look at you
                  my heart skips a beat
                  I wonder if you know, my love,

                  I leave it there for you to do
                  whatever that you wish
                  You could take my heart,
                  and love me,

                  Cinderella

                  I’m standing on the stairs in a magnificent hall
                  Wearing the dress that I bought for the ball
                  It’s long and flowing, sparkling white
                  My tiara of diamonds shines in the light
 
                  At the bottom of the stairs you’re waiting for me
                  And I gracefully float down for all to see
                  You take my hand and touch my face
                  You’re the only one I notice in the expansive space
 
                  We’re now dancing in shadows of flickering light
                  Holding each other close, holding each other tight
                  You kiss my neck and then touch my face
                  Then kiss my lips in a loving embrace
 
                  Time stands still whilst we are together
                  Feels so good, it seems like forever
                  I look at the clock, that cannot be right
                  But the bells start to chime, confirming midnight
 
                  But there’s no need to leave
                  From the ball tonight
                  I’ll be with you my prince
                  For the rest of our life.

                  You touched my hand and lit a spark in my body,
                  You stared into my eyes and saw straight into my soul,
                  You put your arms around me and I was finally complete.

                  Your kiss touches me as gentle as a breeze.
                  Your touch is as tender as that of a child.
                  Your hug is warm, meek, and mild.
                  Each day we grow older and its plain to see,
                  The love that you give me is all that I need.

                  Or the right line
                  So we sit

                  But it’s not uncomfortable
                  In fact I love it
                  You rest your head on my chest
                  As we lay here
                  Lovers entwined
                  Hearts tangled
                  You raise your head
                  And look into my eyes
                  And I see our love
                  Almost as if it’s a real force
                  I don’t ever want to lose this moment
                  You lay your head on my chest once again
                  And now I can feel your heartbeat
                  And my hearts skips
                  And I finally find the words I’m looking for
                  I love you

                  I love you for the melody,
                  I hear within your voice.
                  The way your blue eyes hold me,
                  A captive, but by choice.
 
                  I love you for your gentle hands,
                  That melt away my pain.
                  I love you for your loving heart,
                  That made mine beat again.
                   
                  I love you for your loving smile,
                  With which my old heart soars.
                  These are some of the reasons,
                  Every second beat is yours.

                  The day you appeared I lost my heart
                  To you, to love.
                  And from that day I cannot part
                  From you, from love.

                  You hold me tight
                  To you, to love.
                  In my thoughts all day and night
                  Of you, of love.

                  I offer all that I have to give
                  To you, to love.
                  And all my days I want to live
                  With you, in love.

                  Inside Of Me 
 
                  If you could see inside my soul
                  see inside my heart
                  you would know how I long for you
                  whenever we're apart
 
                  If you could see inside my head
                  if thoughts were things to see
                  you would know how I cherish you
                  how much you mean to me
 
                  In all the ways you comfort me
                  the way you hold me near
                  the way you know just what to do
                  to chase away my fear
 
                  The sparkle in your beautiful eyes
                  your smile, laugh, your touch
                  are just a few of many reasons
                  I love you oh so much
 
                  Knowing I can talk to you
                  about any and everything
                  and knowing together we will get
                  through whatever life may bring
 
                  I could search the whole world over
                  and this I know is true
                  I would never find another love
                  like the love I found with you
 
                  Though with each new day, each sunrise
                  we can't  know what's in store
                  there is one thing I know for sure
                  each day I love you more
 
                  So if you could see inside my head
                  if thoughts were things to see
                  you would know I blessed I feel
                  to have you here with me

                  Key To My Heart

                  I had closed the door upon my heart
                  And wouldn't let anyone in,
                  I had trusted and loved only to be hurt
                  But, that would never happen again.
 
                  I had locked the door and tossed the key
                  As hard, and as far as I could,
                  Love would never enter there again,
                  My heart was closed for good.
 
                  Then you came into my life
                  And made me change my mind,
                  Just when I thought that tiny key
                  was impossible to find.
 
                  That's when you held out your hand
                  And proved to me I was wrong,
                  Inside your palm was the key to my heart...
                  You had it all along.

                  It's Been Years

                  It’s been years since we first met
                  Since we looked into each other's eyes
                  Not realizing that we were meant to be together
                  It's been years since we shared our first laugh
                  Our first smile
                  Since we shared our first kiss
                  I remember how strong your arms embraced me
                  How soft you held me
                  How warm and gentle you were
                  I remember how passionate that first kiss was
                  Now my heart is dancing
                  Happy, knowing that it's been years
                  It's been years since we first met
                  And you're still here kissing me just the same
                  You're still here holding me just the same
                  What I felt for you is still the same
                  It's been years
                  And that feeling will never change

                  Whispers in the Wind

                  Your whispers are gentle echoes
                  that sway ardent winds of harmony
                  and in the symphony of life
                  each word is wrapped in rhapsody.

                  We travel separate roads of life
                  gather flowers along the way and
                  share the music of their fragrance.

                  We exist between two winds,
                  I here under a pale moon
                  you, the other end of somewhere.

                  Sometimes when wind blows through trees
                  I pause to listen and in its passing
                  I hear the tenderness of your voice
                  that fills the spectrum of my soul.

                  You are the chime of warm rain,
                  the moon that glows through the trees
                  and within the luster of evening
                  your aura fills the scene.

                  I hear the whispers of the wind
                  see the stars shine in the sky,
                  but I hold the sunrise in my pocket.

                  Dance with me within the wind,
                  then just let me love you.

                  A Perfect Moment

                  Beautiful eyes open across a pillow top,
                  It seems for this moment time will stop,
                  The earth slows and sounds wane,
                  A frozen moment without stain.
 
                  Your body close to mine,
                  Our hearts beat in time,
                  With a smile of simple pleasure,
                  This moment should last forever.
 
                  Some say perfection is unattainable
                  For most things that's explainable,
                  But in your arms and with your heart's affection
                  I have found a brief moment of perfection.

                  We were sitting on your rooftop
                  Staring at the skies
                  The sun was dipping lower
                  I looked into your eyes
                  You saw what I was feeling
                  I know you felt it too
                  We wanted time to just stand still
                  Then forever there'd be me and you
                  Why can't we freeze this moment?
                  Return to it in time
                  Stay together through the years
                  Proclaim I'm yours and you are mine
                  So let us freeze this moment
                  Store it safely away
                  Even if we leave this place
                  We'll return to it someday

                  Your essence, your being,

                  Back to a time way back.
 
                  Back when charming princes
                  In shining armor, on white horses,
                  Flourished, their swords,
                  Making the princesses swoon.
 
                  You do that to me,
                  Make me laugh, and fret,
                  And swoon, on occasion.
 
                  But without a sword,
                  Or a great white horse,
                  Or armor,
                  You are still a prince.
 
                  And my prince,
                  Whom I'd swoon over,
                  Any day.

                  My Vow To You
 
                  I know you're going crazy,
                  I've been there too.
                  I can see how the weight is making your knees bend,
                  Let me take some of it from you.
                  Don't keep yourself closed off,
                  I am here for you to open up and let go.
                  There is so much you can't forget or forgive,
                  Let me help you cope, we can work things out together.
                  I hear the pain in your voice,
                  You need me now.
                  Don't worry, I'll move heaven and hell to get there.
                  You can't talk, you won't talk about it,
                  I understand.
                  Put your worries in my hands.
                  Lay your head down,
                  And believe that I will do anything to stop your tears.
                  You're ready to give up, you've stopped,
                  I want to be able to give you the strength to keep going.
                  Link arms with me, Let's move on,
                  As one living, breathing, loving, being.
                  Know that you can put faith in me.
                  I will be your rock, I will be your dwelling,
                  I am here with you, for you always.

                  When I Saw Your Eyes
  
                  When you came to your door tonight,
                  And your beautiful eyes gazed at me
                  From the darkness within,
                  The world around me came to a stop,
                  For just a few seconds,
                  As I saw the love from within you.

                  You looked at me with your warm smile,
                  Your black hair around your face,
                  And whispered softly, "hi baby",
                  And once again,
                  I was at your mercy.

                  For when you look into my soul
                  And I hear the sound of your sweet voice,
                  My heart opens to you my love,
                  With all of my dreams now fulfilled.
 
                  I never knew that a love like this
                  Could ever exist,
                  A love that consumes me,
                  A love so powerful,
                  And so overwhelming,
                  That I fear if I were without it,
                  My heart would no longer have a meaning
                  To its existence,
                  For the love that flows through it now, 
                  Is what keeps me alive,
                  Keeps me whole.
 
                  As I gaze into your eyes my love,
                  Down into the depths of your very being,
                  I can see the love you feel for me,
                  A love as strong as my own,
                  A love that fills me so full of emotion,
                  So full of hope for the future,
                  That I pray I will spend the rest of my days,
                  Gazing into your eyes.

                  Young Love
  
                  Love is patient, love is kind,
                  And what our loves express is true.
                  No amount of tragedy can tear
                  Or break the love I have for you.

                  Time has healed our many wounds,
                  But has not erased the memory.
                  But we'll hold on, we'll stay together.
                  We will get through this, you and me.

                  Though we are young and still learning
                  About ourselves, our world today,
                  In my heart, I'll always love you,
                  And in my heart you'll always stay.

                  As days go by, as time progresses,
                  We will change, mature, and always grow.
                  But as we grow, as we reminisce,
                  There is one thing I will always know.

                  My love for you will never falter,
                  Never cease, for it's always true.
                  With love comes patience, but it's worth the wait,
                  To share my unending love with you.

                  Awakening

                  That morning whisper
                  A gentle kiss
                  A suspended moment
                  Of perfect bliss

                  That precious feeling
                  As eyes first meet
                  Bodies entwined
                  In sleepy heat

                  Fingers touching
                  Breath as one
                  Hearts in rhythm
                  We greet the sun

                  Content, in truth
                  Just to be
                  Simply enjoying
                  You and me

                  One Fateful Day
 
                  No river's span is quite as vast
                  No mountain's reach so high.
                  No rose's scent is quite as sweet
                  As the love I hold inside.
 
                  Every time I see your face and
                  Every time you smile,
                  Every time I kiss your lips,
                  My love grows all the while
 
                  I’m the luckiest man to walk the earth
                  To know a love like yours
                  Loving is so easy now
                  You’ve opened my heart’s doors.
  
                  And I'll love you 'til my life has ceased
                  And still more with my soul
                  Because that fateful day we met,
                  My heart you forever stole.

                  A Heart Remembers
 
                  A memory burned within, from a heartfelt second long ago
                  a moment... one single moment, that only a heart can remember
                  a fleeting thought, gone astray, but the feeling looms inside you
                  a boy and a girl... so far apart, so long the days
                  that it took their hearts to remind them...
                  how fortunate they are, that a heart...
                  can return a fleeting thought,
                  one single moment, or a memory burned within...
                  so they can now live as one
                  as only inside true love, can such a past remain
                  until... it's found again

                  Love Letter
 
                  A fire that is carefully stoked and tended will not burn out.
                  It will blaze so brightly that its warmth lingers in your heart.
                  It will beckon your tired soul and embrace you in its radiance.
                  The familiar smell of its smoke can bring a wistful smile,
                  and the occasional blast of fireworks can take your breath away.
                  Its sizzle can enthrall you; its flickering flames entrance you.
                  The glowing embers provide comforting heat,
                  and the knowledge that a subtle movement or gentle breeze
                  can rekindle a bonfire.

                  My love, the spark that ignited the day we met
                  remains an eternal flame.

                  How blessed I am that you are in my life
                  How honoured I am to be a part of yours
                  Memories made and shared
                  With you the one I love

                  It's perfect, and touches me deep
                  First thing in the morning, when I hear you speak
                  And last thing at night as you bid me sweet dreams
                  The brush of your lips lets me know what you mean
 
                  And all of the hours that pass through the day
                  Those spent together and when you're away
                  I think of you always, imagine your touch
                  Think how to show you, I love you so much
 
                  So when we're apart, and you long for me near
                  Just try to remember, you're already here
                  For deep in my heart, where no one can see
                  You'll be forever, together we'll be

                  Saying I Do

                  Saying I do
                  Is more than saying I love you
                  It goes beyond describing how my love is true
                  Because words are not enough to express my love for you.

                  Saying I do
                  Is like saying I am here for you
                  That I am ready to see what the future may bring
                  Because we are together in everything.

                  Saying I do
                  Is saying I am now complete because of you
                  That the pieces of the puzzle called "my life"
                  Becomes a beautiful picture called "our love".

                  And now I am saying "I DO" 
                  As I walk down the aisle with you
                  This is a lifetime promise that I will hold
                  A promise I make until we grow old.

                  How long can you keep up that face?
                  How many times tonight will your lips unfurl to a smile?
                  How can you work in this place concealing such grace?
                  How would you like to leave with me... and see the world for a while?

                  Hang up your apron and baggy jeans for this little number,
                  Come dance with me through the night until morning light,
                  Laughing and singing through streets wrapt in slumber,
                  Your soft ebony eyes reflecting an Italian moon, so magnificently bright.

                  Let me take your hand, oh this night we set sail,
                  On a thrilling journey to a remote place called love,
                  Making memories and writing our own midnight tale,
                  A side by side silhouette, diamond-set dark velvet above.

                  Without even trying, you emit beauty, passion and elegance,
                  From your slender model figure to your lush flowing hair,
                  Dancing in the wind, my heart shocked by your electric radiance,
                  The breath-taking waitress, mi manchi tanto Maria.

                  Missing Treasure

                  The missing treasure of this sinking vessel
                  On the seafloor, where it would nestle
                  Against the base for years it'd lay
                  Patiently waiting for that special day
                  When I would come to claim my prize
                  Hoping the chest to my surprise
                  Would hold the heart that I've been missing
                  The talks, the laughs, the hugs, the kissing
                  That day has come and now I'll find
                  What lies ahead, no longer behind
                  I've searched through darkness, to the deepest sea
                  And found that chest staring back at me
                  What lies inside, I do not know
                  Unlock the latch and open slow
                  I peek within, with nerves I'm shaking
                  The prize inside could stop the aching
                  Cause within the chest that I've searched for
                  I found the heart and even more
                  The talks, the laughs, they all were there
                  The hugs, the kisses, for me to share
                  The most beautiful treasure I've finally seized
                  Did not imagine I could be so pleased
                  I searched so long through the deep sea blue
                  I love you baby, my prize is you

                  Thank You

                  The sun sets
                  Upon the golden sand
                  We sit together
                  Hand in hand

                  We gently embrace
                  And look into each other's eyes
                  I wonder if you are
                  An angel in disguise

                  You hold me
                  Like there's no tomorrow
                  I suddenly forget
                  The past sorrow

                  I kiss your soft lips
                  And you kiss mine
                  I never knew
                  Loving someone could be this fine

                  You pick me up
                  And carry me to our room
                  Oh how a love can blossom
                  And a heart can bloom.

                  Your touch is so gentle
                  But your hands so strong
                  How could a love like this
                  Ever go wrong?

                  My heart is beating
                  200 times a minute
                  Because my love
                  You are in it

                  The sound of your heartbeat
                  All through the night
                  We fall asleep in each other's arms
                  And wake to the morning light.

                  I look into your eyes
                  And this is when
                  I say "Thank You"
                  For teaching me to love again.

                  Once I was a beautiful shell
                  Giving life to the creatures of the sea
                  Tides and time pounded on me, breaking me bit by bit
 
                  Then I was stuck nowhere to go...
                  The barnacles found a place to dwell
                  But Mother Ocean gave me a second chance
 
                  The tides washed me upon the shore
                  There I lay waiting in the sun, dull and chipped and ugly
                  Then, you came along and found me
 
                  The barnacles were picked, the sand washed off
                  You polished me up and brought out my luster...
                  I'm still chipped with imperfections
                  But you laid me out for everyone to see...
                  The beautiful colors inside me
 
                  Now I'm shiny with colors and gold
                  The tides have yet to see me grow old
                  With the tenderness and care you gave me
                  I am once again a beautiful shell

                  Courting Cambria

                  Autumn eyes stare out at me,
                  Silky locks of burnished brown,
                  Poise, elegance and aristocracy,
                  Statuesque, splendor, and magnificence,
                  All words pale,
                  All words fail,
                  To bind the beautiful Cambria
 
                  Beauty be not lonely,
                  Virtue is her friend,
                  Gentle, sweet, with wits abound,
                  Her voice so sweet, has songbird sound,
                  Yet the Lexicon pales,
                  The language fails,
                  To bespeak beguiling Cambria.
 
                  I'd cross not mountains for her,
                  I'd move them one by one.
                  I'd walk not burning sands,
                  Instead I'd seed her lands.
                  Her world would fill with statues,
                  And gardens at her feet.
                  These things I say would happen,
                  Each time we came to meet.
 
                  She makes a man become a man,
                  Makes him strive for more.
                  She makes him wish for worthiness,
                  Remake his very core.
                  Thus I pay my homage,
                  Poetic tribute not mere prose.
                  I give to her this piece of me,
                  And not some dying rose.

                  Like A Rose

                   My love for you is like a red, red rose,
                   It started as a seed but it’s grown and grown.
                   Its roots reach deep down inside of my chest,
                   And it grows even more with each passing breath.
                   The delicate petals lay beautiful and pure,
                   All the doubts that I’ve had you have since cured.
                   For all the thorns that this proud rose bears,
                   They are all softened by the thought of your care.
                   Soon the rose grows old and withers and dies,
                   But the love that helped grow it will last for all time.

                  Releasing the passion inside me that burns for you
                  Intertwining our destinies, so that we two soul mates
                  Now and forever, can live out our hopes and dreams
                  Creating our own bond of life, to overcome the challenges
                  Explore the mysteries, and to enjoy life as it should be
                  Sharing the peace and love, that everyone looks for
                  So in the end I want nothing, because I have everything I need

                  Near You

                  'Neath velvet cloth of night and shadows,
                  my heart confessed its thoughts to the wind.
                  I could feel your smile from a distance
                  with the touch of your closeness profound.

                  The sun reached behind a fading sky,
                  so the moon could take its proper place.
                  Day to darkness, brightened by the stars,
                  leaving upon the blue waters
                  a shimmering portrait of your face.

                  You, with all your savoring sweetness,
                  tenderly pierced the walls of my soul
                  as you wove a new tapestry with
                  the golden threads of your hope and love.

                  Yesterday you offered me courage,
                  today you endowed me with your strength.
                  Every moment together, a gift.
                  Every day a celebration of life.

                  How lovely the music of your heart.
                  You are the air I breathe, sound I hear
                  and the spirit that gently moves me.
                  I don't wish for the moon, I have the stars.

                  Beauty Beyond Memory

                  When memories cry
                  When memories fade and die
 
                  I'm going to grow old
                  My passion
                  My fiery passion
                  My flaming lust is going to grow cold
 
                  But my heart will always flow with a molten, love lava
                  In your name this lava flows through my veins
                  My heart beats for you
                  My heart will never cease to beat your name
 
                  When I lose my charm and my glamour
                  When I lose my physique and my game
                  When I'm old and wrinkly
                  When I cannot look myself in the mirror
                  I'll still stare at you
 
                  When memories fade
                  When I forget the days of the week
                  And the months of the year
                  When I mix names
                  And faces
                  The memory of you
                  Will always shine bright and clear
                  Your image
                  Has been burnt to my memory
                  I will never forget your radiance and beauty
 
                  I will die happy
                  With the image of your sweet smile
                  On my mind
                  And love
                  On my lips and in my heart

                  I make this solemn promise to you:

                  To be your lover when you need to be loved,
                  your doctor when you are ill,
                  your army when you go to war,
                  your umbrella when life rains down on you,
                  your rock when you get weary,
                  your shield when you need defense,
                  your spirit when you are drained,
                  your pillow when you need to rest,
                  your voice when no one can hear you,
                  your ear when no one will listen,
                  your comfort when you feel pain,
                  your hero when you are under duress,
                  your sunshine when darkness falls,
                  your answer when questions arise,
                  your inspiration to overcome obstacles,
                  your hand to hold when you are frightened,
                  your kiss that wakes you everyday,
                  and your "I love you" each and every night.

                  I am yours... all of me.

                  Breeze skipping over water,
                  Water reflecting lights strung over the bridge,
                  Lights shining in your eyes.

                  The fresh, bold feeling of something new,
                  As winter melts into liquid spring,
                  And summer takes shape and ripens alongside love.

                  The petals from the flowering trees, snow for the summer,
                  Floating down around us as we kiss,
                  Once, twice, then forever.

                  You aren’t just my sunshine.

                  You're my sun.

                  When I was little,
                  I had a lush dream,
                  That one day I find
                  And marry a Queen.
 
                  She'd sit by my side,
                  Up there on our throne,
                  With princes and princesses
                  So we're never alone.
 
                  I can honestly say,
                  My dream has come true
                  And you'd never believe
                  Just how much I love you.
 
                  I may not be king
                  And you may not be queen
                  But together we're perfect
                  Just like in my dream.

                  You look into my eyes and my heart beat skips.
                  I stroke your back skin so soft and smooth,
                  I admire your face, every line, every groove.
                  We move in a little closer, our bodies entwine,
                  you touch my neck, it sends shivers down my spine.
                  You whisper that you love me and I know it's true
                  because I feel it in my heart and I love you too.

                  Love Does Separate Us (L'Amour Nous Sépare)
 
                  Through all time, love has strung beautiful art,
                  Does love now weave this vision in my heart?
                  Have two stars been taken straight from the sky,
                  Do they look back at me as I look into your eyes?
                  Love does separate us in lands so far,
                  Love does make this a trial so hard.
                  May I ask for one night to shrink this land,
                  May I have you just one night, just to reach your hand?
                  If my wish I may have not, let us kiss with our minds,
                  Let our words carry us together on winds of divine.
                  Love does separate us in lands far away,
                  But if love does ring true, I'll get to you some way.

                  When it comes to lovin' couples,
                  don't we make the perfect pair-
                  There's romance, love, and laughter
                  in the friendship that we share.
                  We care enough to listen,
                  to trust and understand.
                  To build a life together,
                  side by side and hand in hand.
                  We both know that we're lucky
                  and we've got a good thing going.
                  Through ups and downs
                  and give and take,
                  our love just keeps on growing...
                  'Cause I bring out the best in you,
                  and you the best in me-
                  I guess it takes the two of us
                  to make the perfect "we."

                  Mi Canon in "D"

                  You are my love, my life, my best chance to live free,
                  my eyes when I watch the sun setting over the sea,
                  my lungs when the cool breeze blows softly into me,
                  you are my ears when I listen to Canon in D.

                  My sweetest sweet, my dearest dear,
                  my trust and hope and my freedom of all fears,
                  always my love, no matter how far or how near...

                  The oceans so vast as far as one can see
                  under the sky so blue, beyond the mountains' highest peaks,
                  so far, deep and long my love for you,
                  so strong and lasting, so real and true...

                  The beauty of your eyes looking into mine,
                  your skin, your hair all so soft and so fine...
                  how lucky am I that you could be all mine.

                  Alas my angel I have found and she has found me,
                  so far, far away but I still hear her heart beat,
                  beyond all hopes and more than any dream,
                  I now believe in fate and in destiny.

                  You are the shore to a shipwrecked soul

                  The first time I laid eyes on you
                  A seed was sown within me.
                  Since then it has grown,
                  Its creeping tendrils ensnaring my heart,
                  Filling my head with thoughts of you.
                  Now a fiery blossom is blooming,
                  Radiating passion, stirring up longing.
                  Each day with you,
                  These feelings grow stronger.
                  Standing near you I am enchanted
                  For I am in the presence of an angel.
                  No longer can these feelings be held in.
                  From my chest they burst outward
                  In this confusion only one thing is certain.
                  I love you.

                  but time has moved on.

                  The roses have wilted,
                  their scent is all gone.
                  The petals are faded,
                  but my love will live on.

                  no other like it, uniquely you;
                  all perfect curves, from head to toe;
                  from hips to calves, from eyes to nose;
                  both inside and outside, your brilliance flows;

                  though hard it is, each passing day;
                  I am bolstered too, each sunless night;
                  your voice I hear, turns dark to light;
                  I want you now, stay near to me;
                  eyes open wide, still you I see

                  But Little Did I Know

                  I remember like it was yesterday, the day I first saw your face.
                  I remember your smile so vividly, your beauty and your grace.
                  But little did I know. I could not comprehend,
                  that you would touch my life so much by becoming my best friend.

                  Your hand embraced with mine, the star lit sky did see
                  How, although my chest was pounding, I dropped down to one knee.
                  I didn't think my heart had room, for my love to grow
                  There's just no way to love you more, but how little did I know.

                  Dressed in white, our eyes then met, standing in that sacred room.
                  When we both agreed to be man and wife my love for you did bloom.
                  I cannot explain. My heart just grew. I've never felt this way.
                  But little did I know, that I'd love you more each day.

                  The memories remain, yet those days are now long past.
                  The time has gone so sweet and slow, but at the same time fast.
                  My love for you is greater now, than it ever was before.
                  But little do I know right now, how much I'll love you more.

                  Bountiful butterflies

                  Wings passionately painted
                  Within me they're stirring.

                  Such an elating BUZZ!
                  Oh Honey! What can it BEE!?
                  Something with a sweet sting,

                  I remember that day when all with the world was right
                  Everything seemed so very, very bright
                  As we travelled for hours along that winding road
                  Stopping here and there for photos to upload

                  The autumn colours as beautiful as a sunset
                  It was that very day our spirits finally met
                  In a place finally free from dark subdued light
                  Suddenly, we were finally shining so bright

                  A little overwhelming, I had said it could be
                  You needed to breath, take a break from me
                  And now you understand those dizzy thoughts
                  The ones you created with the love you brought

                  The love I hold finally to be shared
                  With my friend for whom my love has been bared
                  This love not to be hidden, but now open for all to see
                  My heart freely given, please take all of me

                  Your heart too my love you gave for me to hold
                  and it's safe, deep within my hearts stronghold
                  Forever to be cherished and nourished
                  For what a day it will be to see that heart flourish

                  Keep that smile upon your face my love
                  and those sparkling eyes keep them looking above
                  For those shooting stars that I'll send tonight
                  Will keep our love pure and shining throughout the dark night

                  Christmas time is here again
                  I wish you only knew,
                  How special Christmas is this year
                  Because I am with you.

                  This year I don't need any gifts
                  Beneath the Christmas tree
                  The only thing I'll ever want
                  Is you to be with me

                  I put you on my Christmas list
                  And mailed it like a kid
                  But if Santa didn't bring you here
                  An angel surely did

                  You're my favorite gift of all
                  You've filled my heart with cheer
                  I hope that I can be with you
                  On Christmas every year

                  Our Second First Kiss

                  We dwell on the past, while living the present
                  But I admit, the past was unpleasant
                  Full of ups and downs, less pleasure more pain
                  We wished for the sun, but only got rain
                  We both made mistakes, put pain in our hearts
                  But here we are again, promising to never part
                  Counting our blessings and letting go of the past
                  Starting all over and making it last
                  Feelings and memories flow deep in my mind
                  Of those days our love was genuine and kind
                  Holding you close, feeling your skin
                  You look into my eyes and make my head spin
                  Those feelings are back, but stronger than ever
                  I know you're the one I wanna hold on to forever
                  We both smile again, nothing's better than this
                  Kissing you again was like our second first kiss.

                  Our Story

                  My grizzled eyes stalked your lissome limbs
                  And discovered camouflaged curves.
                  I purred a secret smile.

                  I'm not reckless and thought to retire.
                  But then your winsome smile.
                  My surprised spirit soared on seldom seen condor wings.

                  My excitement ripened like a restrained volcano.
                  You snared my mind with comfortable associations.
                  We progressed; each touch thrilled arousal.

                  Now, you welcome my eyes, my lips, and my feckless fingers.
                  My touch is no trespass.
                  You've let me pass the sentries around your soul.

                  And we soar.

                  You're the reason for these butterflies
                  That are fluttering uncontrollable inside of me
                  These butterflies will never calm
                  They've taken over my whole body
 
                  You're the reason for this smile
                  That brightens my whole face
                  This smile will never frown
                  You've unknowingly became my all
 
                  You make me feel alive once again
                  You've erased my past with just a touch
                  Chased my fears with just one glance
                  You broke my mold with that first kiss
 
                  I thought my happiness was forbidden
                  Until you took my world and killed my demons
                  Read into all my deepest dreams
                  And gave them beautiful wings
 
                  You're the reason I believe in love

                  My Love... Everlasting
 
                  You were a dream...
                  A dream that filled my thoughts
                  and my loneliest nights.
 
                  You were the dream I held on to,
                  the dream my heart longed to one day have.
 
                  You were the dream that made me smile...
                  an escape from my reality,
                  a fantasy I longed to one day come true.
 
                  Once only my dream, my escape, my fantasy,
                  came true the day when I first saw you.
 
                  My dream that used to be
                  is now my reality.
 
                  A fantasy waiting for its happy ending
                  is now a fairytale come true.
 
                  Once my only escape...
                  is now the comfort that I live for.
 
                  Together we have been through the heartaches...
                  the pain of walking away or being left behind.
 
                  Every new road we had to take
                  because of the choices we had to make,
                  only paved the road
                  that brought us closer to one another.
 
                  Life may not be easy,
                  with all the burdens and drama
                  that life hands to us,
                  but when you find someone
                  to share your life with,
                  no drama is hard to handle...
                  no burden is hard to bare.
 
                  When you have someone...
                  the one that you've dreamed of...
                  then your life becomes the escape you both take
                  to get away from the reality that surrounds.
 
                  I know because...
                  I found the love...
                  my lifetime partner
                  my soul mate
                  in YOU!

                  I wanted a mansion once... that is until I met you,
                  Now the only place I want to live is inside your heart
                  I once desired diamonds... until I met you,
                  Now the only sparkle I need comes from within
                  I used to crave the finest clothing... until I met you,
                  Now I want not a single thread to separate our bodies
                  I once coveted a fancy car... until I met you,
                  Now I want nothing that would put miles between us
                  I once prayed for money... until I met you,
                  Now I want none of the things money can buy
                  I once yearned for a sense of security... until I met you,
                  Now my only security comes is knowing you are near
                  I once dreamt of a prestigious job... until I met you,
                  Now I find my success in knowing that you are happy
                  I once asked for the world on a silver platter... until I met you,
                  Now you are my world and I want for nothing but your touch
                  Loving you has been my teacher; you taught me not to want
                  Being with you has been my discovery; you are all that I need
                  Finding you has been my salvation, I now understand grateful
                  But perhaps of most importantly...
                  Your love in return has been my everything

                  Autumn Sonnet (for Dennis)

                  Now autumn's here, winter's not far away.
                  Already you've attained three score and ten.
                  We notice now the shortening of the day,
                  Our spring and summer gone, won't come again.
                  Although our love is young, we're growing old
                  So savour mellow fruitfulness a while.
                  Let's glory in the autumn and be bold,
                  We'll laugh and greet each new day with a smile.
                  Give me your hand my love and let us be
                  Close friends, fond lovers, help-mates to the end,
                  And best of all to be good company,
                  Sharing whatever else this life may send.
                  Come kiss me love and hold me in your arms
                  Before cold winter freezes all my charms.

                  Without you I'm nothing,
                  With you I'm a superhero.

                  Watch with me,
                  the butterflies dancing by,
                  until the journey's end.
                  Not knowing where their travels lead,
                  in light and love, my friend.
 
                  Flecks of light,
                  across the azure sky,
                  gently they descend.
                  Settle weary wings on your open hand,
                  in faith and trust, my friend.
 
                  Carry our wishes,
                  beyond the stars,
                  as we watch our life transcend.
                  We journey down the starlit path,
                  in life and love, my friend.

                  The Way I Feel
 
                  The way I feel,
                  when I'm with you,
                  I forget my troubles,
                  like there's just us two.

                  You make my heart,
                  beat fast and strong,
                  and you make me feel,
                  that I truly belong.

                  You fill the gaps,
                  inside my heart,
                  like I've finally found,
                  my missing part.

                  I sink in your eyes,
                  I'm warmed by your smile,
                  and the world is perfect,
                  just for a while.

                  You make life better,
                  than it used to be.
                  You are the sugar,
                  in my cup of tea.

                  Whenever you need me,
                  I'll always be there.
                  I'll be there to talk to,
                  I'll be there to care.

                  Because for you,
                  I would do anything.

                  Deep into the green of the forest
                  I once took to safari
                  To discover the secrets of the wild.
                  Among the thickets and the bushes
                  I saw a flower in blossom
                  Shining like in its first day of bloom.

                  That was one time my eyes fell on you
                  Among the population in my home town
                  Like the flower that I saw...
                  It was you shining among them
                  You comforted my heart
                  Making me come up to you.

                  That was then the day
                  Like a dove that had lost its partner
                  I cooed, you to woo.
                  How you made me discover my lyrics again
                  To you I sang and danced
                  Song after song I spoke my heart to you.

                  Little did I know wild flower
                  You would return love in abundance
                  Like the sands of the sea...
                  Day after day I shovel for love
                  Ever abundant, never ending
                  The reason my heart follows you.

                  Tempted and pleased with your ways
                  In the wild I would never let you be.
                  With care and utmost wanting I dug you up
                  Planting you in the garden of my heart
                  There you flourish
                  There you bloom and shine.

                  When I gaze in rapturous admiration
                  At your perfection and beauty
                  And stare in wonder and longing
                  At your swaying, feline grace,
                  Oh, how it is better to remain silent
                  Than attempt in total futility
                  To describe the awe I feel
                  About matters that speech is incompetent to express
                  Or strive to convey in vain my wondrous elation,
                  As I immerse myself in your cerulean eyes
                  And with utmost joy, tell you,
                  Just how much I love you.

                  In My Arms, In My Heart

                  I was lonely and somewhat lost
                  I wanted a companion and friend, nothing more
                  I took the plunge, in I stepped
                  Nervous and unsure, I waded in
 
                  Unexperienced and quite unsure
                  Feeling trepidation, I wondered if I did right
                  Feeling shy but needing a ladies company
                  I took a chance, to see what would occur
 
                  Surprise, shock and so much joy
                  I found the woman of my dreams, I won first prize
                  Gentle, caring, trusting and sensuous, along you came
                  Into my life, you brought happiness, fulfilment
                  And everything I had secretly yearned for
 
                  Not sure how I would cope and react
                  From that first meeting I was complete
                  Such emotions flowed through me
                  That I believed I would never feel

                  Beauty, tenderness, faith, desire and love came fast
                  All my hidden dreams were answered
                  By your marvellous presence
 
                  From that first meeting, who would believe
                  Such a strong romance would start
                  When we are together all I need
                  Is in my arms, in my heart

                  Come With Me

                  Mystery, it clouds your form
                  Ecstasy, it keeps us warm
                  The dance has begun, with but us two
                  I'll take your hand, I'll walk with you
                  Take me to depths in the sea of love
                  Go with me further, never enough
                  I'll breathe in your perfumed scent
                  You intoxicate, invade my head

                  Give in to your senses, here we go
                  Follow me now, let your heart take control
                  Our time is short, and death is nigh
                  To mountains and peaks, we must fly
                  Leave life behind in our own world
                  Get away from it all, run with me, my pearl
                  Forget all your troubles, walk in the moonlight
                  Gaze into my eyes, stay with me tonight

                  We need not fear, we must venture on
                  Forsake loneliness, drink in our love's song
                  Pure angel of dawn, you've stolen my heart
                  You illuminate me, pierce the dark
                  Your purity, it leaves me numb
                  Your beauty, where does it come from?
                  I long to touch your smooth, soft skin
                  To stroke your hair, give you everything

                  To pull you into my embrace
                  To hear you breathe, to see your face
                  To feel your heart beat softly with mine
                  To hold you tightly, leave reason behind
                  To draw you in, to taste your kiss
                  All heartbreak gone, nothing amiss
                  I'd lose myself inside your eyes
                  Stay in love forever, mesmerized

                  Run away with me, barefoot in the sand
                  Walk by my side, rule all the lands
                  Hear our hearts beating with love so wild
                  Our heads spinning with passion, my child
                  There's untamed joy we can't contain
                  Hypnotizing ardor we can't explain
                  I'm Romeo, will you be Juliet?
                  We can share a bond we'll never forget

                  We can clasp hands in the twilight
                  Hold each other, day and night
                  We can be alone, just me and you
                  Our souls entwined, you know it's true
                  We can do anything, if you'll take faith
                  I'll protect you, I'll keep you safe
                  We can be together eternally
                  We can live forever – so come with me

                  When nights are long & friends are few,
                  I sit by my window & think of you,
                  A silent whisper, a silent tear,
                  I love you with all my heart,
                  I wish you were here

                  When I Look Back
 
                  When I look back
                  On the dreams I left behind;
                  Buried there in all my thoughts
                  It is you I always find.
 
                  I saw you then as I see you now
                  Through love's impassioned blindness,
                  A heart so fashioned there within
                  Filled with love and kindness.

                  How often has my heart declared
                  With anguish, for my words are few,
                  That the wind shall blow a little longer,
                  To keep me here with you.

                  Sweeter still are the pains of love.
                  The bonds of love grow stronger,
                  Even after the moonlight has gone to sleep,
                  I shall always love you longer.

                  No other can stir my heart so deep,
                  Or thrill me through and through,
                  And in my dreams there will never be
                  No other love but you.

                  When I look back to times gone by
                  There is one sure thing I know
                  It is you my love, who stole my heart
                  Fifty years ago.

                  Ode to A Beautiful Girl
 
                  Your magnificent eyes, dark emeralds aflame
                  Your silky bronzed hair, still perfect in rain
                  The way you walk, a light antelope in prance
                  So cheerful and happy, ever ready to dance
                  Your lithe Brazilian figure, I marvel through the days
                  How beautiful you do become, in the wondrous sunshine rays
                  On those rare moments, when your eyes meet mine
                  I feel a warm pleasure and a chill down my spine
                  When I hear your sweet laughter, a melodious tune
                  I feel alive, full of joy; I could fly to the moon
                  I sit idly nigh always wishing you'd see
                  Perhaps even come and sit down next to me
                  I watch how you smile, and send jolts through my heart
                  Your sensual features a fine work of art
                  Sometimes I watch the evening's amber sun
                  And I calm myself down, from thoughts weighing a tonne
                  The soothing orange invigorates my mind
                  As do you, always so kind

                  Amoroso
 
                  We have climbed the tall blue mountain,
                  to touch the eagle's wing,
                  Trekked the valley far below them,
                  to drink from crystal springs,

                  We have walked among the tall grasses,
                  through wildflowers we were lead,
                  They stood like noble kings and queens,
                  with crowns upon their heads,

                  The goldfinch and her family,
                  they kiss like you and I,
                  In the morning and come the evening,
                  they sing sweet lullabies,

                  I look back across the seasons,
                  thankful you were there,
                  To have wrapped my arms around you,
                  put ribbons in your hair,

                  If tomorrow holds my promise,
                  it will be to forever gaze into your eyes,
                  And dance with you forever,
                  in a land with no good-byes.

                  To The One I Love

                  Beautiful lady, lily of the field
                  You, my umbrella and my shield
                  Your adoration showers like the rains
                  And drowns all odds and pains.

                  Searching everywhere unto the crest
                  Clear you stood above the rest
                  For never in my dreams most sweet
                  Did I such a lovely damsel meet.

                  Mesmerised I am, dreaming all the while
                  Of when we shall walk down the aisle
                  To vows we take we shall keep
                  With our affection ever deep.
   
                  For eternity our love shall sprout
                  Though the world be in drought
                  A union most blissful, this I know
                  For we ever shall sparkle and glow.

                  You are the treasure every pirate wants to keep.
                  You are the sun that gives life to my day.
                  You are the moon that lights the dark way.
                  You are the kiss that sets me free.
                  You are the embrace that comforts me.
                  You are the yin and yang of my life.
                  So I ask you now, please be my wife.

                  That sparkle and laugh, that can smile and cry,
                  I love your eyes so clear and true.
                  Beautiful lady I adore you.
 
                  A twinkling look that bubbles bright,
                  With a heart to care, and a heart to love,
                  With hands to hold, and hands to help,
                  Beautiful lady there to give.
 
                  Beautiful lady, a smile so bright,
                  So warm and gentle, so soft. A delight.
                  A voice so clear,
                  That calms and soothes, a voice that wipes all fears.
 
                  Beautiful lady,
                  I'll give to you, my thoughts, my prayers, my hopes,
                  I offer you my heart, my strength.
                  My love is yours for ever.
 
                  Beautiful lady,
                  I love you as you are.
                  Beautiful.

                  Thoughts...

                  I thought that I'd seen beauty
                  I thought I'd witnessed grace,
                  I thought that I'd known love
                  'Til I gazed upon your face.

                  I thought I'd felt my heart beat
                  I thought my knees were weak,
                  I thought I'd heard a songbird
                  Until I heard you speak.

                  I thought the rose was fragrant
                  I thought the sky was blue,
                  I thought nature wonderful
                  'Til I first laid eyes on you.

                  I thought the sun was shining
                  I thought I'd seen it all,
                  I thought that I was standing
                  Until you made me fall.

                  I thought my eyes were open
                  Yet now I'm not so sure,
                  I think that I may be in love
                  Like I've never loved before.

                  I'll hold on to these feelings
                  And keep them safe within,
                  Until the time they're needed
                  And true love can begin...

                  A New Season

                  Soft, wet, warm, like summer rain
                  Cooling my core,
                  Settling the ache,
                  Waiting abated,
                  We fall, in love
                  And Winter never comes.

                  For My Husband

                  Loving you has no end and no beginning
                  Loving you is everything
                  It is infinite in time
                  And limitless in magnitude
                  Beyond even my own comprehension

                  Your love brings me home
                  Enfolds me and warms me
                  In its eternal embrace
                  Endless and palpable
                  Beyond all life's storms

                  A connection like no other
                  Twenty years long
                  But timeless in our hearts
                  Deep and true
                  Til' death us do part

                  Like the warmth of the morning sun,
                  So do thoughts of you embrace me,
                  Revealing how alive I am

                  A glorious light of the new day,
                  so is your presence in my life,
                  relieving it of its shadows,
                  and marking the start of a new beginning

                  If Only You Knew

                  In the darkness of the night, there is only me and you,
                  We are woven together in our very own cocoon.

                  I feel your heartbeat against my chest,
                  I hold you tight as we both rest.

                  I start to drift off to sleep,
                  And think of how I turned complete.

                  I am only complete when you are near,
                  To lose you someday is my biggest fear.

                  It takes two halves to make a whole,
                  My heart and yours we make one soul.

                  We are here my love together again
                  Back where we should have always been
                  Back where we were meant to be
                  Together as one just you and me
 
                  While we were apart it seemed so wrong
                  I longed for you my whole life long
                  I ached to be with you so very much
                  To hear your voice to feel your touch
 
                  And now at last we've met once more
                  In love again as we were before
                  More in love than we could have ever supposed
                  Together again life's circle closed.

                  Your Husband
  
                  When times are hard, when news is bad,
                  When life seems a universe from brightness and joy,
                  When this happens, my love, I need you to know,
                  There is a person close who feels every tear,
                  A person close who holds you dear.
 
                  When you cry, he cries too, not always to see,
                  But always and with the full depth of his beating heart.
                  When you do not cry but the pain shows in your eyes,
                  He will know and share this too,
                  His passion hidden under a stoic umbrella,
                  A shield of calm prevents emotion displayed.
 
                  He knows of your journey through the turbulence of life,
                  He respects and admires the tireless fight,
                  He hates a world that could cause you pain,
                  Such innocence undeserving, he longs for your return to the sun,
                  A summer's mind where fears dissipate like seeds in wind,
                  To see what he loves; your smile to infinity,
                  Your passion for life... with vigour, with humour, with cheer.
 
                  So look over your shoulder and he'll be there,
                  No matter the distance, the time, he'll be there,
                  Watching you in sleep, aloof in morning haze,
                  As distance grows through day, the care for you remains.
                  He is your husband, your friend, your protector, your knight,
                  He is me my darling, he is me.

                  and only for you
                  it can't be denied
                  for it dwells in my soul
                  with you I'm alive
                  you make me whole
 
                  Kiss me my love 
                  and join me in bliss
                  my love  is forever
                  and so is my kiss
                  your gaze my great joy
                  to you I belong
                  our love  is the lyric
                  you are my song
 
                  Kiss me my love 
                  and give me that smile
                  my love  is forever
                  a promise that I'll
                  dream only of you
                  awaking to find
                  the dream's before me
                  the joy of my mind
 
                  Kiss me my love 
                  again and again
                  my love  is  forever
                  a deep seated yen
                  awash in your love 
                  with you as my wife
                  So thankful for you
                  the best gift of my life
